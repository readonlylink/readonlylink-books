C libraries provide us with security, audio and video, databases, communications, and protocols. This "fabric layer" powers the Internet and our apps. Yet it's mostly single threaded and hand-crafted. C is an old language with no sense of humor. It is minimalist, portable, and fast, yet also painful to use, messy, and fragile. In this book I'll explain "Scalable C," which kicks C into the 21st Century. We use actors, message passing, code generation, and other tricks. I've been writing C for 30 years. It's never been this fun and productive.
