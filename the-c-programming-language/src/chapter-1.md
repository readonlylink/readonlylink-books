title: Chapter 1
subtitle: A Tutorial Introduction
---

Let us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the
essential elements of the language in real programs, but without
getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions.  At this point,
we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the
examples are meant to be correct). We want to get you as quickly as
possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do
that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants,
arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and
output. We are intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C
that are important for writing bigger programs. These include
pointers, structures, most of C's rich set of operators, several
control-flow statements, and the standard library.

This approach and its drawbacks.  Most notable is that the complete
story on any particular feature is not found here, and the tutorial,
by being brief, may also be misleading.  And because the examples do
not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as
they might be. We have tried to minimize these effects, but be
warned. Another drawback is that later chapters will necessarily
repeat some of this chapter.  We hope that the repetition will help
you more than it annoys.

In any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate
from the material in this chapter to their own programming needs.
Beginners should supplement it by writing small, similar programs of
their own. Both groups can use it as a framework on which to hang the
more detailed descriptions that begin in Chapter 2.

# 1.1 Getting Started

The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing
programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all
languages:

Print the words

```
hello, world
```

This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create
the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it,
and find out where your output went.  With these mechanical details
mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.

In C, the program to print "hello, world" is

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a
specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the
program in a file whose name ends in ".c", such as `hello.c`, then
compile it with the command

```
cc hello.c
```

If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or
misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and make
an executable file called `a.out`. If you run `a.out` by typing the
command

```
a.out
```

it will print

```
hello, world
```

On other systems, the rules will be different; check with a local
expert.

Now, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program,
whatever its size, consists of _functions_ and _variables_.  A
function contains _statements_ that specify the computing operations
to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C
functions are like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the
procedures and functions of Pascal. Our example is a function named
`main`.  Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names
you like, but "main" is special - your program begins executing at the
beginning of main. This means that every program must have a `main`
somewhere.

`main` will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some
that you wrote, and others from libraries that are provided for
you. The first line of the program,

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

tells the compiler to include information about the standard
input/output library; the line appears at the beginning of many C
source files. The standard library is described in Chapter 7 and
Appendix B.

One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling
function to provide a list of values, called _arguments_, to the
function it calls.  The parentheses after the function name surround
the argument list. In this example, `main` is defined to be a function
that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list `( )`.

**The first C program**

```c
// include information about standard library
#include <stdio.h>

// define a function called `main`
// that received no argument values
main()

// statements of `main` are enclosed in braces
{
    // `main` calls library function `printf`
    // to print this sequence of characters
    // `\n` represents the newline character
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

The statements of a function are enclosed in braces `{ }`. The function
`main` contains only one statement,

```c
printf("hello, world\n");
```

A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of
arguments, so this calls the function `printf` with the argument
`"hello, world\n"`. `printf` is a library function that prints output,
in this case the string of characters between the quotes.

A sequence of characters in double quotes, like `"hello, world\n"`, is
called a _character string_ or _string constant_.  For the moment our
only use of character strings will be as arguments for `printf` and
other functions.

The sequence `\n` in the string is C notation for the _newline
character_, which when printed advances the output to the left margin
on the next line. If you leave out the `\n` (a worthwhile experiment),
you will find that there is no line advance after the output is
printed. You must use `\n` to include a newline character in the
`printf` argument; if you try something like

```c
printf("hello, world
");
```

the C compiler will produce an error message.

`printf` never supplies a newline character automatically, so several
calls may be used to build up an output line in stages. Our first
program could just as well have been written

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, ");
    printf("world");
    printf("\n");
}
```

to produce identical output.

Notice that `\n` represents only a single character.  An _escape
sequence_ like `\n` provides a general and extensible mechanism for
representing hard-to-type or invisible characters.  Among the others
that C provides are `\t` for tab, `\b` for backspace, `\"` for the
double quote and `\\` for the backslash itself. There is a complete
list in Section 2.3.

**Exercise 1-1**.  Run the "hello, world" program on your system.
Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error
messages you get.

**Exercise 1-2**. Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`'s
argument string contains `\c`, where c is some character not listed
above.

# 1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

The next program uses the formula `°C=(5/9)(°F-32)` to print the
following table of Fahrenheit temperatures and their centigrade or
Celsius equivalents:

```
1    -17
20   -6
40   4
60   15
80   26
100  37
120  48
140  60
160  71
180  82
200  93
220  104
240  115
260  126
280  137
300  148
```

The program itself still consists of the definition of a single
function named `main`. It is longer than the one that printed `"hello,
world"`, but not complicated.  It introduces several new ideas,
including comments, declarations, variables, arithmetic expressions,
loops , and formatted output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
main()
{
    int fahr, celsius;
    int lower, upper, step;

    lower = 0;      /* lower limit of temperature scale */
    upper = 300;    /* upper limit */
    step = 20;      /* step size */

    fahr = lower;
    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
        printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }
}
```

The two lines

```c
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
```

are a _comment_, which in this case explains briefly what the program
does.  Any characters between `/*` and `*/` are ignored by the
compiler; they may be used freely to make a program easier to
understand. Comments may appear anywhere where a blank, tab or newline
can.

In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at
the beginning of the function before any executable statements.  A
_declaration_ announces the properties of variables; it consists of a
name and a list of variables, such as

```c
int fahr, celsius;
int lower, upper, step;
```

The type `int` means that the variables listed are integers; by
contrast with `float`, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that
may have a fractional part. The range of both `int` and `float`
depends on the machine you are using; 16-bits `int`s, which lie
between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit `int`s. A `float`
number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant
digits and magnitude generally between about 10^-38 and 10^+38.

C provides several other data types besides `int` and `float`, including:

| type     | meaning                         |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `char`   | character - a single byte       |
| `short`  | short integer                   |
| `long`   | long integer                    |
| `double` | double-precision floating point |

The size of these objects is also machine-dependent.  There are also
_arrays_, _structures_ and _unions_ of these basic types, _pointers_
to them, and _functions_ that return them, all of which we will meet
in due course.

Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the
_assignment statements_

```c
lower = 0;
upper = 300;
step = 20;
```

which set the variables to their initial values.  Individual
statements are terminated by semicolons.

Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that
repeats once per output line; this is the purpose of the `while` loop

```c
while (fahr <= upper) {
   ...
}
```

The `while` loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is
tested. If it is true (`fahr` is less than or equal to `upper`), the
body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is
executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is
executed again. When the test becomes false (`fahr` exceeds `upper`)
the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows
the loop.  There are no further statements in this program, so it
terminates.

The body of a `while` can be one or more statements enclosed in
braces, as in the temperature converter, or a single statement without
braces, as in

```c
while (i < j)
    i = 2 * i;
```

In either case, we will always indent the statements controlled by the
`while` by one tab stop (which we have shown as four spaces) so you
can see at a glance which statements are inside the loop.  The
indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program.  Although
C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation
and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to
read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using
blanks around operators to clarify grouping.  The position of braces
is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs.  We have
chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you,
then use it consistently.

Most of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius
temperature is computed and assigned to the variable `celsius` by the
statement

```c
celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
```

The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just
multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer
division _truncates_: any fractional part is discarded.  Since 5 and 9
are integers. 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius
temperatures would be reported as zero.

This example also shows a bit more of how `printf` works.  `printf` is
a general-purpose output formatting function, which we will describe
in detail in Chapter 7. Its first argument is a string of characters
to be printed, with each `%` indicating where one of the other
(second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form
it is to be printed. For instance, `%d` specifies an integer argument,
so the statement

```c
printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
```

causes the values of the two integers `fahr` and `celsius` to be printed,
with a tab (`\t`) between them.

Each `%` construction in the first argument of `printf` is paired with
the corresponding second argument, third argument, etc.; they must
match up properly by number and type, or you will get wrong answers.

By the way, `printf` is not part of the C language; there is no input
or output defined in C itself. `printf` is just a useful function from
the standard library of functions that are normally accessible to C
programs. The behaviour of `printf` is defined in the ANSI standard,
however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and
library that conforms to the standard.

In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input
and output until chapter 7.  In particular, we will defer formatted
input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of
the function `scanf` in Section 7.4.  `scanf` is like `printf`, except
that it reads input instead of writing output.

There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion
program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because
the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment
each `%d` in the `printf` statement with a width, the numbers printed
will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say

```c
printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);
```

to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide,
and the second in a field six digits wide, like this:

```
  0    -17
 20     -6
 40      4
 60     15
 80     26
100     37
120     48
140     60
160     71
180     82
200     93
220    104
240    115
260    126
280    137
300    148
```

The more serious problem is that because we have used integer
arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate; for
instance, 0°F is actually about -17.8°C, not -17. To get more accurate
answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer.
This requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
    for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */
main()
{
    float fahr, celsius;
    float lower, upper, step;

    lower = 0;      /* lower limit of temperatuire scale */
    upper = 300;    /* upper limit */
    step = 20;      /* step size */

    fahr = lower;
    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
        printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }
}
```

This is much the same as before, except that `fahr` and `celsius` are
declared to be `float` and the formula for conversion is written in a
more natural way. We were unable to use `5/9` in the previous version
because integer division would truncate it to zero.  A decimal point
in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so
`5.0/9.0` is not truncated because it is the ratio of two
floating-point values.

If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation
is performed.  If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point
operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be
converted to floating point before the operation is done.  If we had
written `(fahr-32)`, the `32` would be automatically converted to
floating point. Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with
explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes
their floating-point nature for human readers.

The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point
are in Chapter 2. For now, notice that the assignment

```c
fahr = lower;
```

and the test

```c
while (fahr <= upper)
```

also work in the natural way - the `int` is converted to `float`
before the operation is done.

The `printf` conversion specification `%3.0f` says that a
floating-point number (here `fahr`) is to be printed at least three
characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits.
`%6.1f` describes another number (`celsius`) that is to be printed at
least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The
output looks like this:

```
  0  -17.8
 20   -6.7
 40    4.4
 60   15.6
 80   26.7
100   37.8
120   48.9
140   60.0
160   71.1
180   82.2
200   93.3
220  104.4
240  115.6
260  126.7
280  137.8
300  148.9
```

Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: `%6f` says
that the number is to be at least six characters wide; `%.2f`
specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not
constrained; and `%f` merely says to print the number as floating
point.


| example | meaning                                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| %d      | print as decimal integer                                           |
| %6d     | print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide               |
| %f      | print as floating point                                            |
| %6f     | print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide                |
| %.2f    | print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point          |
| %6.2f   | print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point |

Among others, `printf` also recognizes `%o` for octal, `%x` for
hexadecimal, `%c` for character, `%s` for character string and `%%`
for itself.

**Exercise 1-3**. Modify the temperature conversion program to print a
heading above the table.

**Exercise 1-4**. Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius
to Fahrenheit table.

# 1.3 The for statement

There are plenty of different ways to write a program for a particular
task. Let's try a variation on the temperature converter.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
main()
{
    int fahr;

    for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
        printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```

This produces the same answers, but it certainly looks different.  One
major change is the elimination of most of the variables; only `fahr`
remains, and we have made it an `int`.  The lower and upper limits and
the step size appear only as constants in the `for` statement, itself
a new construction, and the expression that computes the Celsius
temperature now appears as the third argument of `printf` instead of a
separate assignment statement.

This last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context
where it is permissible to use the value of some type, you can use a
more complicated expression of that type.  Since the third argument of
`printf` must be a floating-point value to match the `%6.1f`, any
floating-point expression can occur here.

The `for` statement is a loop, a generalization of the `while`.  If
you compare it to the earlier `while`, its operation should be
clear. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by
semicolons. The first part, the initialization

```c
fahr = 0
```

is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is
the test or condition that controls the loop:

```c
fahr <= 300
```

This condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body of the loop (here
a single ptintf) is executed. Then the increment step

```c
fahr = fahr + 20
```

is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates if
the condition has become false.  As with the `while`, the body of the
loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in
braces.  The initialization, condition and increment can be any
expressions.

The choice between `while` and `for` is arbitrary, based on which
seems clearer.  The `for` is usually appropriate for loops in which
the initialization and increment are single statements and logically
related, since it is more compact than `while` and it keeps the loop
control statements together in one place.

**Exercise 1-5**. Modify the temperature conversion program to print the
table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

# 1.4 Symbolic Constants

A final observation before we leave temperature conversion
forever. It's bad practice to bury "magic numbers" like 300 and 20 in
a program; they convey little information to someone who might have to
read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic
way.  One way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful
names.  A `#define` line defines a _symbolic name_ or _symbolic
constant_ to be a particular string of characters:

```c
#define <name> <replacement list>
```

Thereafter, any occurrence of _name_ (not in quotes and not part of
another name) will be replaced by the corresponding _replacement
text_.  The _name_ has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of
letters and digits that begins with a letter. The _replacement text_
can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define LOWER  0     /* lower limit of table */
#define UPPER  300   /* upper limit */
#define STEP   20    /* step size */

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
main()
{
    int fahr;

    for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
        printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```

The quantities `LOWER`, `UPPER` and `STEP` are symbolic constants, not
variables, so they do not appear in declarations. Symbolic constant
names are conventionally written in upper case so they can ber readily
distinguished from lower case variable names.  Notice that there is no
semicolon at the end of a `#define` line.

# 1.5 Character Input and Output

We are going to consider a family of related programs for processing
character data. You will find that many programs are just expanded
versions of the prototypes that we discuss here.

The model of input and output supported by the standard library is
very simple. Text input or output, regardless of where it originates
or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A _text
stream_ is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line
consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline
character. It is the responsibility of the library to make each input
or output stream confirm this model; the C programmer using the
library need not worry about how lines are represented outside the
program.

The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing
one character at a time, of which `getchar` and `putchar` are the
simplest.  Each time it is called, `getchar` reads the _next input
character_ from a text stream and returns that as its value. That is,
after

```c
c = getchar();
```

the variable `c` contains the next character of input.  The characters
normally come from the keyboard; input from files is discussed in
Chapter 7.

The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:

```c
putchar(c);
```

prints the contents of the integer variable `c` as a character,
usually on the screen.  Calls to `putchar` and `printf` may be
interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls
are made.

## 1.5.1 File Copying

Given `getchar` and `putchar`, you can write a surprising amount of
useful code without knowing anything more about input and output.  The
simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one
character at a time:

```
read a character
    while (charater is not end-of-file indicator)
        output the character just read
        read a character
```

Converting this into C gives:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* copy input to output; 1st version  */
main()
{
    int c;

    c = getchar();
    while (c != EOF) {
        putchar(c);
        c = getchar();
    }
}
```

The relational operator `!=` means "not equal to".

What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course,
like everything else, stored internally just as a bit pattern.  The
type `char` is specifically meant for storing such character data, but
any integer type can be used.  We used `int` for a subtle but
important reason.

The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The
solution is that `getchar` returns a distinctive value when there is
no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real
character. This value is called `EOF`, for "end of file". We must
declare `c` to be a type big enough to hold any value that `getchar`
returns.  We can't use `char` since `c` must be big enough to hold
`EOF` in addition to any possible `char`. Therefore we use `int`.

`EOF` is an integer defined in `<stdio.h>`, but the specific numeric
value doesn't matter as long as it is not the same as any `char`
value.  By using the symbolic constant, we are assured that nothing in
the program depends on the specific numeric value.

The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced
C programmers. In C, any assignment, such as

```c
c = getchar();
```

is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand
side after the assignment.  This means that a assignment can appear as
part of a larger expression. If the assignment of a character to `c`
is put inside the test part of a `while` loop, the copy program can be
written this way:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* copy input to output; 2nd version  */
main()
{
    int c;

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        putchar(c);
}
```

The `while` gets a character, assigns it to `c`, and then tests
whether the character was the end-of-file signal.  If it was not, the
body of the `while` is executed, printing the character.  The `while`
then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the
`while` terminates and so does `main`.

This version centralizes the input - there is now only one reference
to `getchar` - and shrinks the program. The resulting program is more
compact, and, once the idiom is mastered, easier to read. You'll see
this style often. (It's possible to get carried away and create
impenetrable code, however, a tendency that we will try to curb.)

The parentheses around the assignment, within the condition are
necessary. The _precedence_ of `!=` is higher than that of `=`, which
means that in the absence of parentheses the relational test `!=`
would be done before the assignment `=`. So the statement

```c
c = getchar() != EOF
```

is equivalent to

```c
c = (getchar() != EOF)
```

This has the undesired effect of setting `c` to 0 or 1, depending on
whether or not the call of `getchar` returned end of file. (More on
this in Chapter 2.)

**Exercise 1-6**. Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF` is 0 or 1.

**Exercise 1-7**. Write a program to print the value of `EOF`.

## 1.5.2 Character Counting

The next program counts characters; it is similar to the copy program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* count characters in input; 1st version */
main()
{
    long nc;

    nc = 0;
    while (getchar() != EOF)
        ++nc;
    printf("%ld\n", nc);
}
```

The statement

```c
++nc;
```

presents a new operator, `++`, which means _increment by one_. You
could instead write `nc = nc + 1` but `++nc` is more concise and often
more efficient. There is a corresponding operator `--` to decrement
by 1. The operators `++` and `--` can be either prefix operators
(`++nc`) or postfix operators (`nc++`); these two forms have different
values in expressions, as will be shown in Chapter 2, but `++nc` and
`nc++` both increment `nc`.  For the moment we will will stick to the
prefix form.

The character counting program accumulates its count in a `long`
variable instead of an `int`.  `long` integers are at least 32 bits.
Although on some machines, `int` and `long` are the same size, on
others an `int` is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767, and it
would take relatively little input to overflow an `int` counter. The
conversion specification `%ld` tells `printf` that the corresponding
argument is a `long` integer.

It may be possible to cope with even bigger numbers by using a `double`
(double precision `float`). We will also use a `for` statement instead of
a `while`, to illustrate another way to write the loop.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* count characters in input; 2nd version */
main()
{
    double nc;

    for (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc)
        ;
    printf("%.0f\n", nc);
}
```

`printf` uses `%f` for both float and double; `%.0f` suppresses the
printing of the decimal point and the fraction part, which is zero.

The body of this `for` loop is empty, because all the work is done in
the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require
that a `for` statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a
_null statement_, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a
separate line to make it visible.

Before we leave the character counting program, observe that if the
input contains no characters, the `while` or `for` test fails on the
very first call to `getchar`, and the program produces zero, the right
answer.  This is important.  One of the nice things about `while` and
`for` is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with
the body. If there is nothing to do, nothing is done, even if that
means never going through the loop body.  Programs should act
intelligently when given zero-length input.  The `while` and `for`
statements help ensure that programs do reasonable things with
boundary conditions.

## 1.5.3 Line Counting

The next program counts input lines.  As we mentioned above, the
standard library ensures that an input text stream appears as a
sequence of lines, each terminated by a newline. Hence, counting lines
is just counting newlines:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* count lines in input */
main()
{
    int c, nl;

    nl = 0;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        if (c == '\n')
            ++nl;
    printf("%d\n", nl);
}
```

The body of the `while` now consists of an `if`, which in turn
controls the increment `++nl`. The `if` statement tests the
parenthesized condition, and if the condition is true, executes the
statement (or group of statements in braces) that follows.  We have
again indented to show what is controlled by what.

The double equals sign `==` is the C notation for "is equal to" (like
Pascal's single `=` or Fortran's `.EQ`.). This symbol is used to
distinguish the equality test from the single `=` that C uses for
assignment.  A word of caution: newcomers to C occasionally write `=`
when they mean `==`. As we will see in Chapter 2, the result is
usually a legal expression, so you will get no warning.

A character written between single quotes represents an integer value
equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's
character set.  This is called a _character constant_, although it is
just another way to write a small integer.  So, for example, `'A'` is
a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the
internal representation of the character `A`. Of course, `'A'` is to
be preferred over `65`: its meaning is obvious, and it is independent
of a particular character set.

The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in
character constants, so `'\n'` stands for the value of the newline
character, which is 10 in ASCII. You should note carefully that `'\n'`
is a single character, and in expressions is just an integer; on the
other hand, `"\n"` is a string constant that happens to contain only
one character.  The topic of strings versus characters is discussed
further in Chapter 2.

**Exercise 1-8**. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

**Exercise 1-9**. Write a program to copy its input to its output,
replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

**Exercise 1-10**. Write a program to copy its input to its output,
replacing each tab by `\t`, each backspace by `\b`, and each backslash
by `\\`.  This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

## 1.5.4 Word Counting

The fourth in our series of useful programs counts lines, words, and characters, with the loose
definition  that  a  word  is  any  sequence  of  characters  that  does  not  contain  a  blank,  tab  or
newline. This is a bare-bones version of the UNIX program wc.

   #include <stdio.h>

   #define IN   1  /* inside a word */
   #define OUT  0  /* outside a word */

   /* count lines, words, and characters in input */
   main()
   {
       int c, nl, nw, nc, state;

       state = OUT;
       nl = nw = nc = 0;
       while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
           ++nc;
           if (c == '\n')
               ++nl;
           if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
               state = OUT;
           else if (state == OUT) {
               state = IN;
               ++nw;
           }
       }
       printf("%d %d %d\n", nl, nw, nc);
   }
Every time the program encounters the first character of a word, it counts one more word. The
variable state records whether the program is currently in a word or not; initially it is "not in
a word", which is assigned the value OUT. We prefer the symbolic constants IN and OUT to the
literal values 1 and 0 because they make the program more readable. In a program as tiny as
this, it makes little difference, but in larger programs, the increase in clarity is well worth the
modest extra effort to write it this way from the beginning. You'll also find that it's easier to
make  extensive  changes  in  programs  where  magic  numbers  appear  only  as  symbolic
constants.







23

The line

   nl = nw = nc = 0;
sets all three variables to zero. This is not a special case, but a consequence of the fact that an
assignment is an expression with the value and assignments associated from right to left. It's
as if we had written

   nl = (nw = (nc = 0));
The operator || means OR, so the line

   if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
says "if c is a blank or c is a newline or c is a tab". (Recall that the escape sequence \t is a
visible representation of the tab character.) There is a corresponding operator && for AND; its
precedence  is  just  higher  than  ||.  Expressions  connected  by  &&  or  ||  are  evaluated  left  to
right, and it is guaranteed that evaluation will stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known.
If  c is a blank,  there is no need to test  whether it is a newline or tab, so these tests are not
made. This isn't particularly important here, but is significant in more complicated situations,
as we will soon see.

The example also shows an else, which specifies an alternative action if the condition part of
an if statement is false. The general form is

   if (expression)
       statement1
   else
       statement2
One  and  only  one  of  the  two  statements  associated  with  an  if-else  is  performed.  If  the
expression is true, statement1 is executed; if not, statement2 is executed. Each statement can
be a single statement or several in braces. In the word count program, the one after the else is
an if that controls two statements in braces.

Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

1.6 Arrays

Let  is  write  a  program  to  count  the  number  of  occurrences  of  each  digit,  of  white  space
characters (blank, tab, newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us
to illustrate several aspects of C in one program.

There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array to hold the number of
occurrences  of  each  digit,  rather  than  ten  individual  variables.  Here  is  one  version  of  the
program:







24

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* count digits, white space, others */
   main()
   {
       int c, i, nwhite, nother;
       int ndigit[10];

       nwhite = nother = 0;
       for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
           ndigit[i] = 0;

       while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
           if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
               ++ndigit[c-'0'];
           else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
               ++nwhite;
           else
               ++nother;

       printf("digits =");
       for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
           printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
       printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n",
           nwhite, nother);
   }
The output of this program on itself is

   digits = 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, white space = 123, other = 345
The declaration

   int ndigit[10];
declares  ndigit to be an array of 10 integers. Array subscripts always start at zero in C, so
the  elements  are  ndigit[0],  ndigit[1],  ...,  ndigit[9].  This  is  reflected  in  the  for
loops that initialize and print the array.

A subscript can be any integer expression, which includes integer variables like i, and integer
constants.

This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits.
For example, the test

   if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is

   c - '0'
This  works  only  if  '0',  '1',  ...,  '9'  have  consecutive  increasing  values.  Fortunately,
this is true for all character sets.

By definition,  chars are just small integers, so char variables and constants are identical to
ints  in  arithmetic  expressions.  This  is  natural  and  convenient;  for  example  c-'0'  is  an
integer  expression  with  a  value  between  0  and  9  corresponding  to  the  character  '0'  to  '9'
stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit.

The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with
the sequence












25

   if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
       ++ndigit[c-'0'];
   else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
       ++nwhite;
   else
       ++nother;
The pattern

   if (condition1)
       statement1
   else if (condition2)
       statement2
       ...
       ...
   else
       statementn
occurs frequently in programs as a way to express a multi-way decision. The conditions are
evaluated  in  order  from  the  top  until  some  condition  is  satisfied;  at  that  point  the
corresponding  statement  part  is  executed,  and  the  entire  construction  is  finished.  (Any
statement can be several statements enclosed in braces.) If none of the conditions is satisfied,
the statement after the final else is executed if it is present. If the final else and statement
are omitted, as in the word count program, no action takes place. There can be any number of

else if(condition)
  statement

groups between the initial if and the final else.

As a matter of style, it is advisable to format this construction as we have shown; if each if
were indented past the previous else, a long sequence of decisions would march off the right
side of the page.

The  switch statement, to be discussed in Chapter 4, provides another way to write a multi-
way  branch  that  is  particulary  suitable  when  the  condition  is  whether  some  integer  or
character expression matches one of a set of constants. For contrast, we will present a switch
version of this program in Section 3.4.

Exercise 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is
easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

Exercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters
in its input.

1.7 Functions

In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran, or a procedure or function
in Pascal. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation, which can
then be used without worrying about its implementation. With properly designed functions, it
is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient. C makes the sue of
functions easy, convinient and efficient; you will often see a short function defined and called
only once, just because it clarifies some piece of code.





26

So  far  we  have  used  only  functions  like  printf,  getchar  and  putchar  that  have  been
provided  for  us;  now  it's  time  to  write  a  few  of  our  own.  Since  C  has  no  exponentiation
operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definition by writing
a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of
power(2,5)  is  32.  This  function  is  not  a  practical  exponentiation  routine,  since  it  handles
only  positive  powers  of  small  integers,  but  it's  good  enough  for  illustration.(The  standard
library contains a function pow(x,y) that computes xy.)

Here  is  the  function  power  and  a  main  program  to  exercise  it,  so  you  can  see  the  whole
structure at once.

   #include <stdio.h>

   int power(int m, int n);

    /* test power function */
    main()
    {
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
            printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));
        return 0;
    }

    /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */
    int power(int base, int n)
    {
        int i,  p;

        p = 1;
        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            p = p * base;
        return p;
    }
A function definition has this form:

return-type function-name(parameter declarations, if any)
{
   declarations
   statements
}
Function definitions can appear in any order, and in one source file or several, although no
function  can  be  split  between  files.  If  the  source  program  appears  in  several  files,  you  may
have to say more to compile and load it than if it all appears in one, but that is an operating
system matter, not a language attribute. For the moment, we will assume that both functions
are in the same file, so whatever you have learned about running C programs will still work.

The function power is called twice by main, in the line

   printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));
Each call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted
and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. (Not all functions
produce an integer value; we will take this up in Chapter 4.)

The first line of power itself,











27

    int power(int base, int n)
declares the parameter types and names, and the type of the result that the function returns.
The  names  used  by  power  for  its  parameters  are  local  to  power,  and  are  not  visible  to  any
other function: other routines can use the same names without conflict. This is also true of the
variables i and p: the i in power is unrelated to the i in main.

We will generally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function.
The terms formal argument and actual argument are sometimes used for the same distinction.

The value that power computes is returned to main by the return: statement. Any expression
may follow return:

   return expression;
A function need not return a value; a return statement with no expression causes control, but
no  useful  value,  to  be  returned  to  the  caller,  as  does  "falling  off  the  end"  of  a  function  by
reaching the terminating right brace. And the calling function can ignore a value returned by a
function.

You may have noticed that there is a  return statement at the end of  main. Since  main is a
function like any other, it may return a value to its caller, which is in effect the environment in
which  the  program  was  executed.  Typically,  a  return  value  of  zero  implies  normal
termination;  non-zero  values  signal  unusual  or  erroneous  termination  conditions.  In  the
interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this
point, but we will include them hereafter, as a reminder that programs should return status to
their environment.

The declaration

    int power(int base, int n);
just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an
int.  This  declaration,  which  is  called  a  function  prototype,  has  to  agree  with  the  definition
and uses of power. It is an error if the definition of a function or any uses of it do not agree
with its prototype.

parameter  names  need  not  agree.  Indeed,  parameter  names  are  optional  in  a  function
prototype, so for the prototype we could have written

    int power(int, int);
Well-chosen names are good documentation however, so we will often use them.

A note of history: the biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions
are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been
written like this:







28

   /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */
   /*         (old-style version) */
   power(base, n)
   int base, n;
   {
       int i, p;

       p = 1;
       for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
           p = p * base;
       return p;
   }
The  parameters  are  named  between  the  parentheses,  and  their  types  are  declared  before
opening the left brace; undeclared parameters are taken as int. (The body of the function is
the same as before.)

The declaration of power at the beginning of the program would have looked like this:

    int power();
No  parameter  list  was  permitted,  so  the  compiler  could  not  readily  check  that  power  was
being called correctly. Indeed, since by default power would have been assumed to return an
int, the entire declaration might well have been omitted.

The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in
the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition still works
in ANSI C, at least for a transition period, but we strongly recommend that you use the new
form when you have a compiler that supports it.

Exercise 1.15. Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function
for conversion.

1.8 Arguments - Call by Value

One  aspect  of  C  functions  may  be  unfamiliar  to  programmers  who  are  used  to  some  other
languages,  particulary  Fortran.  In  C,  all  function  arguments  are  passed  "by  value."  This
means  that  the  called  function  is  given  the  values  of  its  arguments  in  temporary  variables
rather than the originals. This leads to some different properties than are seen with "call by
reference" languages like Fortran or with var parameters in Pascal, in which the called routine
has access to the original argument, not a local copy.

Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. It usually leads to more compact programs
with fewer extraneous variables, because parameters can be treated as conveniently initialized
local variables in the called routine. For example, here is a version of power that makes use of
this property.

   /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0; version 2 */
   int power(int base, int n)
   {
       int p;

       for (p = 1; n > 0; --n)
           p = p * base;
       return p;
   }







29

The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs
backwards)  until  it  becomes  zero;  there  is  no  longer  a  need  for  the  variable  i.  Whatever  is
done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with.

When  necessary,  it  is  possible  to  arrange  for  a  function  to  modify  a  variable  in  a  calling
routine. The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to
the variable), and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the
variable indirectly through it. We will cover pointers in Chapter 5.

The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value
passed  to  the  function  is  the  location  or  address  of  the  beginning  of  the  array  -  there  is  no
copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any
argument of the array. This is the topic of the next section.

1.9 Character Arrays

The  most  common  type  of  array  in  C  is  the  array  of  characters.  To  illustrate  the  use  of
character arrays and functions to manipulate them, let's write a program that reads a set of text
lines and prints the longest. The outline is simple enough:

   while (there's another line)
       if (it's longer than the previous longest)
           (save it)
           (save its length)
   print longest line
This  outline  makes  it  clear  that  the  program  divides  naturally  into  pieces.  One  piece  gets  a
new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process.

Since things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too. Accordingly, let us
first write a separate function getline to fetch the next line of input. We will try to make the
function  useful  in  other  contexts.  At  the  minimum,  getline  has  to  return  a  signal  about
possible end of file; a more useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if
end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid
line length. Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing only a newline
has length 1.

When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere.
This suggests a second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place.

Finally, we need a main program to control getline and copy. Here is the result.




30

   #include <stdio.h>
   #define MAXLINE 1000   /* maximum input line length */

   int getline(char line[], int maxline);
   void copy(char to[], char from[]);

   /* print the longest input line */
   main()
   {
       int len;            /* current line length */
       int max;            /* maximum length seen so far */
       char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */
       char longest[MAXLINE]; /* longest line saved here */

       max = 0;
       while ((len = getline(line, MAXLINE)) > 0)
           if (len > max) {
               max = len;
               copy(longest, line);
           }
       if (max > 0)  /* there was a line */
           printf("%s", longest);
       return 0;
   }

   /* getline:  read a line into s, return length  */
   int getline(char s[],int lim)
   {
       int c, i;

       for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF && c!='\n'; ++i)
           s[i] = c;
       if (c == '\n') {
           s[i] = c;
           ++i;
       }
       s[i] = '\0';
       return i;
   }

   /* copy:  copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */
   void copy(char to[], char from[])
   {
       int i;

       i = 0;
       while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
           ++i;
   }
The  functions  getline  and  copy  are  declared  at  the  beginning  of  the  program,  which  we
assume is contained in one file.

main  and  getline  communicate  through  a  pair  of  arguments  and  a  returned  value.  In
getline, the arguments are declared by the line

   int getline(char s[], int lim);
which specifies that the first argument, s, is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The
purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside storage. The length of
an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to











31

send  a  value  back  to  the  caller,  just  as  the  function  power  did.  This  line  also  declares  that
getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted.

Some  functions  return  a  useful  value;  others,  like  copy,  are  used  only  for  their  effect  and
return  no  value.  The  return  type  of  copy  is  void,  which  states  explicitly  that  no  value  is
returned.

getline puts the  character  '\0' (the null character, whose value is zero) at the end of the
array it is creating, to mark the end of the string of characters. This conversion is also used by
the C language: when a string constant like

   "hello\n"
appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the
string and terminated with a '\0' to mark the end.

The  %s  format  specification  in  printf  expects  the  corresponding  argument  to  be  a  string
represented in this form. copy also relies on the fact that its input argument is terminated with
a '\0', and copies this character into the output.

It  is  worth  mentioning  in  passing  that  even  a  program  as  small  as  this  one  presents  some
sticky  design  problems.  For  example,  what  should  main  do  if  it  encounters  a  line  which  is
bigger than its limit? getline works safely, in that it stops collecting when the array is full,
even if no newline has been seen. By testing the length and the last character returned, main
can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. In the interests of
brevity, we have ignored this issue.

There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so
getline checks for overflow. On the other hand, the user of copy already knows (or can find
out) how big the strings are, so we have chosen not to add error checking to it.

Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print
the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

Exercise 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters.

Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input,
and to delete entirely blank lines.

Exercise  1-19.  Write  a  function  reverse(s)  that  reverses  the  character  string  s.  Use  it  to
write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.

1.10 External Variables and Scope

The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they
are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. The same is true
of the variables in other functions; for example, the variable i in getline is unrelated to the i





32

in  copy.  Each  local  variable  in  a  function  comes  into  existence  only  when  the  function  is
called,  and  disappears  when  the  function  is  exited.  This  is  why  such  variables  are  usually
known  as  automatic  variables,  following  terminology  in  other  languages.  We  will  use  the
term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. (Chapter 4 discusses the  static
storage class, in which local variables do retain their values between calls.)

Because  automatic  variables  come  and  go  with function invocation, they do not retain their
values from one call to the next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. If they are not set,
they will contain garbage.

As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to
all  functions,  that  is,  variables  that  can  be  accessed  by  name  by  any  function.  (This
mechanism  is  rather  like  Fortran  COMMON  or  Pascal  variables  declared  in  the  outermost
block.)  Because  external  variables  are  globally  accessible,  they  can  be  used  instead  of
argument  lists  to  communicate  data  between  functions.  Furthermore,  because  external
variables  remain  in  existence  permanently,  rather  than  appearing  and  disappearing  as
functions are called and exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them
have returned.

An  external  variable  must  be  defined,  exactly  once,  outside  of  any  function;  this  sets  aside
storage for it. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it; this
states the type of the variable. The declaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be
implicit  from  context.  To  make  the  discussion  concrete,  let  us  rewrite  the  longest-line
program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls,
declarations, and bodies of all three functions.

   #include <stdio.h>

   #define MAXLINE 1000    /* maximum input line size */

   int max;                /* maximum length seen so far */
   char line[MAXLINE];     /* current input line */
   char longest[MAXLINE];  /* longest line saved here */

   int getline(void);
   void copy(void);

   /* print longest input line; specialized version */
   main()
   {
       int len;
       extern int max;
       extern char longest[];

       max = 0;
       while ((len = getline()) > 0)
           if (len > max) {
               max = len;
               copy();
           }
       if (max > 0)  /* there was a line */
           printf("%s", longest);
       return 0;
   }









33

   /* getline:  specialized version */
   int getline(void)
   {
       int c, i;
       extern char line[];

       for (i = 0; i < MAXLINE - 1
            && (c=getchar)) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
                line[i] = c;
       if (c == '\n') {
           line[i] = c;
           ++i;
       }
       line[i] = '\0';
       return i;
   }

   /* copy: specialized version */
   void copy(void)
   {
       int i;
       extern char line[], longest[];

       i = 0;
       while ((longest[i] = line[i]) != '\0')
           ++i;
   }
The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example
above,  which  state  their  type  and  cause  storage  to  be  allocated  for  them.  Syntactically,
external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of
functions, the variables are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name
of  the  variable  must  be  made  known  to  the  function;  the  declaration  is  the  same  as  before
except for the added keyword extern.

In  certain  circumstances,  the  extern  declaration  can  be  omitted.  If  the  definition  of  the
external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is
no need for an extern declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline
and  copy are thus redundant. In fact, common practice is to place definitions of all external
variables at the beginning of the source file, and then omit all extern declarations.

If the program is in several source files, and a variable is defined in file1 and used in file2 and
file3, then extern declarations are needed in file2 and file3 to connect the occurrences of the
variable. The usual practice is to collect extern declarations of variables and functions in a
separate  file,  historically  called  a  header,  that  is  included  by  #include  at  the  front  of  each
source  file.  The  suffix  .h  is  conventional  for  header  names.  The  functions  of  the  standard
library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h>. This topic is discussed at length
in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B.

Since the specialized versions of getline and copy have no arguments, logic would suggest
that  their  prototypes  at  the  beginning  of  the  file  should  be  getline()  and  copy().  But  for
compatibility  with  older  C  programs  the  standard  takes  an  empty  list  as  an  old-style
declaration,  and  turns  off  all  argument  list  checking;  the  word  void  must  be  used  for  an
explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4.

You  should  note  that  we  are  using  the  words  definition  and  declaration  carefully  when  we
refer to external variables in this section."Definition" refers to the place where the variable is







34

created or assigned storage; "declaration" refers to places where the nature of the variable is
stated but no storage is allocated.

By  the  way,  there  is  a  tendency  to  make  everything  in  sight  an  extern  variable  because  it
appears to simplify communications - argument lists are short and variables are always there
when you want them. But external variables are always there even when you don't want them.
Relying  too  heavily  on  external  variables  is  fraught  with  peril  since  it  leads  to  programs
whose data connections are not all obvious - variables can be changed in unexpected and even
inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to modify. The second version of the longest-line
program  is  inferior  to  the  first,  partly  for  these  reasons,  and  partly  because  it  destroys  the
generality  of  two  useful  functions  by  writing  into  them  the  names  of  the  variables  they
manipulate.

At  this  point  we  have  covered  what  might  be  called  the  conventional  core  of  C.  With  this
handful of building blocks, it's possible to write useful programs of considerable size, and it
would probably be a good idea if you paused long enough to do so. These exercises suggest
programs of somewhat greater complexity than the ones earlier in this chapter.

Exercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number
of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.
Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

Exercise  1-21.  Write  a  program  entab  that  replaces  strings  of  blanks  by  the  minimum
number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab.
When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
preference?

Exercise 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after
the  last  non-blank  character  that  occurs  before  the  n-th  column  of  input.  Make  sure  your
program  does  something  intelligent  with  very  long  lines,  and  if  there  are  no  blanks  or  tabs
before the specified column.

Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to
handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments don't nest.

Exercise  1-24.  Write  a  program  to  check  a  C  program  for  rudimentary  syntax  errors  like
unmatched  parentheses,  brackets  and  braces.  Don't  forget  about  quotes,  both  single  and
double,  escape  sequences,  and  comments.  (This  program  is  hard  if  you  do  it  in  full
generality.)
