title: Chapter 8
subtitle: The UNIX System Interface
---

The UNIX operating system provides its services through a set of system calls, which are in
effect  functions  within  the  operating  system  that  may  be  called  by  user  programs.  This
chapter  describes  how  to  use  some  of  the  most  important  system  calls  from  C  programs.  If
you use UNIX, this should be directly helpful, for it is sometimes necessary to employ system
calls for maximum efficiency, or to access some facility that is not in the library. Even if you
use  C  on  a  different  operating  system,  however,  you  should  be  able  to  glean  insight  into  C
programming from studying these examples; although details vary, similar code will be found
on any system. Since the ANSI C library is in many cases modeled on UNIX facilities, this
code may help your understanding of the library as well.

This chapter is divided into three major parts: input/output, file system, and storage allocation.
The  first  two  parts  assume  a  modest  familiarity  with  the  external  characteristics  of  UNIX
systems.

Chapter  7  was  concerned  with  an  input/output  interface  that  is  uniform  across  operating
systems.  On  any  particular  system  the  routines  of the standard library have to be written in
terms of the facilities provided by the host system. In the next few sections we will describe
the UNIX system calls for input and output, and show how parts of the standard library can be
implemented with them.

8.1 File Descriptors

In  the  UNIX  operating  system,  all  input  and  output  is  done  by  reading  or  writing  files,
because  all  peripheral  devices,  even  keyboard  and  screen,  are  files  in  the  file  system.  This
means  that  a  single  homogeneous  interface  handles  all  communication  between  a  program
and peripheral devices.

In the most general case, before you read and write a file, you must inform the system of your
intent to do so, a process called opening the file. If you are going to write on a file it may also
be necessary to create it or to discard its previous contents. The system checks your right to
do so (Does the file exist? Do you have permission to access it?) and if all is well, returns to
the program a small non-negative integer called a file descriptor. Whenever input or output is
to be done on the file, the file descriptor is used instead of the name to identify the file. (A file
descriptor is analogous to the file pointer used by the standard library, or to the file handle of
MS-DOS.) All information about an open file is maintained by the system; the user program
refers to the file only by the file descriptor.

Since  input  and  output  involving  keyboard  and  screen  is  so  common,  special  arrangements
exist to make this convenient. When the command interpreter (the "shell") runs a program,
three files are open, with file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, called the standard input, the standard
output, and the standard error. If a program reads 0 and writes 1 and 2, it can do input and
output without worrying about opening files.

The user of a program can redirect I/O to and from files with < and >:

   prog <infile >outfile





In this case, the shell changes the default assignments for the file descriptors 0 and 1 to the
named files. Normally file descriptor 2 remains attached to the screen, so error messages can
go there. Similar observations hold for input or output associated with a pipe. In all cases, the
file assignments are changed by the shell, not by the program. The program does not know
where its input comes from nor where its output goes, so long as it uses file 0 for input and 1
and 2 for output.

152

8.2 Low Level I/O - Read and Write

Input and output uses the read and write system calls, which are accessed from C programs
through two functions called read and write. For both, the first argument is a file descriptor.
The  second  argument  is  a  character  array  in  your  program  where  the  data  is  to  go  to  or  to
come from. The third argument is the number is the number of bytes to be transferred.

   int n_read = read(int fd, char *buf, int n);
   int n_written = write(int fd, char *buf, int n);
Each call returns a count of the number of bytes transferred. On reading, the number of bytes
returned may be less than the number requested. A return value of zero bytes implies end of
file,  and  -1  indicates  an  error  of  some  sort.  For  writing,  the  return  value  is  the  number  of
bytes written; an error has occurred if this isn't equal to the number requested.

Any  number  of  bytes  can  be  read  or  written  in  one  call.  The  most  common  values  are  1,
which  means  one  character  at  a  time  ("unbuffered"),  and  a  number  like  1024  or  4096  that
corresponds to a physical block size on a peripheral device. Larger sizes will be more efficient
because fewer system calls will be made.

Putting these facts together, we can write a simple program to copy its input to its output, the
equivalent of the file copying program written for Chapter 1. This program will copy anything
to anything, since the input and output can be redirected to any file or device.

   #include "syscalls.h"

   main()  /* copy input to output */
   {
       char buf[BUFSIZ];
       int n;

       while ((n = read(0, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
           write(1, buf, n);
       return 0;
   }
We have collected function prototypes for the system calls into a file called  syscalls.h so
we can include it in the programs of this chapter. This name is not standard, however.

The  parameter  BUFSIZ  is  also  defined  in  syscalls.h;  its  value  is  a  good  size  for  the  local
system. If the file size is not a multiple of BUFSIZ, some read will return a smaller number of
bytes to be written by write; the next call to read after that will return zero.

It is instructive to see how read and write can be used to construct higher-level routines like
getchar, putchar, etc. For example, here is a version of getchar that does unbuffered input,
by reading the standard input one character at a time.








153

   #include "syscalls.h"

   /* getchar:  unbuffered single character input */
   int getchar(void)
   {
       char c;

       return (read(0, &c, 1) == 1) ? (unsigned char) c : EOF;
   }
c must be a char, because read needs a character pointer. Casting c to unsigned char in the
return statement eliminates any problem of sign extension.

The second version of getchar does input in big chunks, and hands out the characters one at
a time.

   #include "syscalls.h"

   /* getchar:  simple buffered version */
   int getchar(void)
   {
       static char buf[BUFSIZ];
       static char *bufp = buf;
       static int n = 0;

       if (n == 0) {  /* buffer is empty */
           n = read(0, buf, sizeof buf);
           bufp = buf;
       }
       return (--n >= 0) ? (unsigned char) *bufp++ : EOF;
   }
If  these  versions  of  getchar  were  to  be  compiled  with  <stdio.h>  included,  it  would  be
necessary to #undef the name getchar in case it is implemented as a macro.

8.3 Open, Creat, Close, Unlink

Other than the default standard input, output and error, you must explicitly open files in order
to read or write them. There are two system calls for this, open and creat [sic].

open  is  rather  like  the  fopen  discussed  in  Chapter  7,  except  that  instead  of  returning  a  file
pointer, it returns a file descriptor, which is just an int. open returns -1 if any error occurs.

   #include <fcntl.h>

   int fd;
   int open(char *name, int flags, int perms);

   fd = open(name, flags, perms);
As with fopen, the name argument is a character string containing the filename. The second
argument, flags, is an int that specifies how the file is to be opened; the main values are

O_RDONLY  open for reading only
O_WRONLY  open for writing only
O_RDWR   open for both reading and writing











These constants are defined in <fcntl.h> on System V UNIX systems, and in <sys/file.h>
on Berkeley (BSD) versions.

154

To open an existing file for reading,

   fd = open(name, O_RDONLY,0);
The perms argument is always zero for the uses of open that we will discuss.

It  is  an  error  to  try  to  open  a  file  that  does  not  exist.  The  system  call  creat  is  provided  to
create new files, or to re-write old ones.

   int creat(char *name, int perms);

   fd = creat(name, perms);
returns a file descriptor if it was able to create the file, and -1 if not. If the file already exists,
creat will truncate it to zero length, thereby discarding its previous contents; it is not an error
to creat a file that already exists.

If the file does not already exist, creat creates it with the permissions specified by the perms
argument. In the UNIX file system, there are nine bits of permission information associated
with a file that control read, write and execute access for the owner of the file, for the owner's
group,  and  for  all  others.  Thus  a  three-digit  octal  number  is  convenient  for  specifying  the
permissions. For example,  0775 specifies read, write and execute permission for the owner,
and read and execute permission for the group and everyone else.

To illustrate, here is a simplified version of the UNIX program cp, which copies one file to
another.  Our  version  copies  only  one  file,  it  does  not  permit  the  second  argument  to  be  a
directory, and it invents permissions instead of copying them.

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <fcntl.h>
   #include "syscalls.h"
   #define PERMS 0666     /* RW for owner, group, others */

   void error(char *,  ...);

   /* cp:  copy f1 to f2 */
   main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       int f1, f2, n;
       char buf[BUFSIZ];

       if (argc != 3)
           error("Usage: cp from to");
       if ((f1 = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
           error("cp: can't open %s", argv[1]);
       if ((f2 = creat(argv[2], PERMS)) == -1)
           error("cp: can't create %s, mode %03o",
               argv[2], PERMS);
       while ((n = read(f1, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
           if (write(f2, buf, n) != n)
               error("cp: write error on file %s", argv[2]);
       return 0;
   }










155

This  program  creates  the  output  file  with  fixed  permissions  of  0666.  With  the  stat  system
call, described in Section 8.6, we can determine the mode of an existing file and thus give the
same mode to the copy.

Notice that the function error is called with variable argument lists much like printf. The
implementation  of  error  illustrates  how  to  use  another  member  of  the  printf  family.  The
standard  library  function  vprintf  is  like  printf  except  that  the  variable  argument  list  is
replaced  by  a  single  argument  that  has  been  initialized  by  calling  the  va_start  macro.
Similarly, vfprintf and vsprintf match fprintf and sprintf.

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdarg.h>

   /* error:  print an error message and die */
   void error(char *fmt, ...)
   {
       va_list args;

       va_start(args, fmt);
       fprintf(stderr, "error: ");
       vprintf(stderr, fmt, args);
       fprintf(stderr, "\n");
       va_end(args);
       exit(1);
   }
There  is  a  limit  (often  about  20)  on  the  number  of  files  that  a  program  may  open
simultaneously.  Accordingly,  any  program  that  intends  to  process  many  files  must  be
prepared  to  re-use  file  descriptors.  The  function  close(int  fd)  breaks  the  connection
between a file descriptor and an open file, and frees the file descriptor for use with some other
file;  it  corresponds  to  fclose  in  the  standard  library  except  that  there  is  no  buffer  to  flush.
Termination of a program via exit or return from the main program closes all open files.

The  function  unlink(char  *name)  removes  the  file  name  from  the  file  system.  It
corresponds to the standard library function remove.

Exercise 8-1. Rewrite the program cat from Chapter 7 using read, write, open, and close
instead  of  their  standard  library  equivalents.  Perform  experiments  to  determine  the  relative
speeds of the two versions.

8.4 Random Access - Lseek

Input and output are normally sequential: each read or write takes place at a position in the
file right after the previous one. When necessary, however, a file can be read or written in any
arbitrary  order.  The  system  call  lseek  provides  a  way  to  move  around  in  a  file  without
reading or writing any data:

   long lseek(int fd, long offset, int origin);
sets the current position in the file whose descriptor is fd to offset, which is taken relative to
the  location  specified  by  origin.  Subsequent  reading  or  writing  will  begin  at  that  position.
origin can be 0, 1, or 2 to specify that offset is to be measured from the beginning, from
the current position, or from the end of the file respectively. For example, to append to a file
(the redirection >> in the UNIX shell, or "a" for fopen), seek to the end before writing:

   lseek(fd, 0L, 2);








156

To get back to the beginning ("rewind"),

   lseek(fd, 0L, 0);
Notice the 0L argument; it could also be written as (long) 0 or just as 0 if lseek is properly
declared.

With lseek, it is possible to treat files more or less like arrays, at the price of slower access.
For example, the following function reads any number of bytes from any arbitrary place in a
file. It returns the number read, or -1 on error.

   #include "syscalls.h"

   /*get:  read n bytes from position pos */
   int get(int fd, long pos, char *buf, int n)
   {
       if (lseek(fd, pos, 0) >= 0) /* get to pos */
           return read(fd, buf, n);
       else
           return -1;
   }
The return value from lseek is a long that gives the new position in the file, or -1 if an error
occurs. The standard library function fseek is similar to lseek except that the first argument
is a FILE * and the return is non-zero if an error occurred.

8.5 Example - An implementation of Fopen and Getc

Let us illustrate how some of these pieces fit together by showing an implementation of the
standard library routines fopen and getc.

Recall  that  files  in  the  standard  library  are  described  by  file  pointers  rather  than  file
descriptors. A file pointer is a pointer to a structure that contains several pieces of information
about  the  file:  a  pointer  to  a  buffer,  so  the  file  can  be  read  in  large  chunks;  a  count  of  the
number of characters left in the buffer; a pointer to the next character position in the buffer;
the file descriptor; and flags describing read/write mode, error status, etc.

The data structure that describes a file is contained in <stdio.h>, which must be included (by
#include)  in  any  source  file  that  uses  routines  from  the  standard  input/output  library.  It  is
also included by functions in that library. In the following excerpt from a typical <stdio.h>,
names that are intended for use only by functions of the library begin with an underscore so
they are less likely to collide with names in a user's program. This convention is used by all
standard library routines.

   #define NULL      0
   #define EOF       (-1)
   #define BUFSIZ    1024
   #define OPEN_MAX  20    /* max #files open at once */

   typedef struct _iobuf {
       int  cnt;       /* characters left */
       char *ptr;      /* next character position */
       char *base;     /* location of buffer */
       int  flag;      /* mode of file access */
       int  fd;        /* file descriptor */
   } FILE;








157

   extern FILE _iob[OPEN_MAX];

   #define stdin   (&_iob[0])
   #define stdout  (&_iob[1])
   #define stderr  (&_iob[2])

   enum _flags {
       _READ   = 01,   /* file open for reading */
       _WRITE  = 02,   /* file open for writing */
       _UNBUF  = 04,   /* file is unbuffered */
       _EOF    = 010,  /* EOF has occurred on this file */
       _ERR    = 020   /* error occurred on this file */
   };

   int _fillbuf(FILE *);
   int _flushbuf(int, FILE *);

   #define feof(p)     ((p)->flag & _EOF) != 0)
   #define ferror(p)   ((p)->flag & _ERR) != 0)
   #define fileno(p)   ((p)->fd)

   #define getc(p)   (--(p)->cnt >= 0 \
                  ? (unsigned char) *(p)->ptr++ : _fillbuf(p))
   #define putc(x,p) (--(p)->cnt >= 0 \
                  ? *(p)->ptr++ = (x) : _flushbuf((x),p))

   #define getchar()   getc(stdin)
   #define putcher(x)  putc((x), stdout)
The  getc  macro  normally  decrements  the  count,  advances  the  pointer,  and  returns  the
character.  (Recall  that  a  long  #define  is  continued  with  a  backslash.)  If  the  count  goes
negative, however, getc calls the function _fillbuf to replenish the buffer, re-initialize the
structure  contents,  and  return  a  character.  The  characters  are  returned  unsigned,  which
ensures that all characters will be positive.

Although  we  will  not  discuss  any  details,  we  have  included  the  definition  of  putc  to  show
that it operates in much the same way as getc, calling a function _flushbuf when its buffer
is full. We have also included macros for accessing the error and end-of-file status and the file
descriptor.

The  function  fopen  can  now  be  written.  Most  of  fopen  is  concerned  with  getting  the  file
opened and positioned at the right place, and setting the flag bits to indicate the proper state.
fopen does not allocate any buffer space; this is done by _fillbuf when the file is first read.

   #include <fcntl.h>
   #include "syscalls.h"
   #define PERMS 0666    /* RW for owner, group, others */

   FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode)
   {
       int fd;
       FILE *fp;

       if (*mode != 'r' && *mode != 'w' && *mode != 'a')
           return NULL;
       for (fp = _iob; fp < _iob + OPEN_MAX; fp++)
           if ((fp->flag & (_READ | _WRITE)) == 0)
               break;        /* found free slot */
       if (fp >= _iob + OPEN_MAX)   /* no free slots */
           return NULL;












158

       if (*mode == 'w')
           fd = creat(name, PERMS);
       else if (*mode == 'a') {
           if ((fd = open(name, O_WRONLY, 0)) == -1)
               fd = creat(name, PERMS);
           lseek(fd, 0L, 2);
       } else
           fd = open(name, O_RDONLY, 0);
       if (fd == -1)         /* couldn't access name */
           return NULL;
       fp->fd = fd;
       fp->cnt = 0;
       fp->base = NULL;
       fp->flag = (*mode == 'r') ? _READ : _WRITE;
       return fp;
   }
This  version  of  fopen  does  not  handle  all  of  the  access  mode  possibilities  of  the  standard,
though adding them would not take much code. In particular, our  fopen does not recognize
the "b" that signals binary access, since that is meaningless on UNIX systems, nor the "+"
that permits both reading and writing.

The  first  call  to  getc  for  a  particular  file  finds  a  count  of  zero,  which  forces  a  call  of
_fillbuf. If _fillbuf finds that the file is not open for reading, it returns EOF immediately.
Otherwise, it tries to allocate a buffer (if reading is to be buffered).

Once the buffer is established, _fillbuf calls read to fill it, sets the count and pointers, and
returns the character at the beginning of the buffer. Subsequent calls to _fillbuf will find a
buffer allocated.

   #include "syscalls.h"

   /* _fillbuf:  allocate and fill input buffer */
   int _fillbuf(FILE *fp)
   {
       int bufsize;

       if ((fp->flag&(_READ|_EOF_ERR)) != _READ)
           return EOF;
       bufsize = (fp->flag & _UNBUF) ? 1 : BUFSIZ;
       if (fp->base == NULL)     /* no buffer yet */
           if ((fp->base = (char *) malloc(bufsize)) == NULL)
               return EOF;       /* can't get buffer */
       fp->ptr = fp->base;
       fp->cnt = read(fp->fd, fp->ptr, bufsize);
       if (--fp->cnt < 0) {
           if (fp->cnt == -1)
               fp->flag |= _EOF;
           else
               fp->flag |= _ERR;
           fp->cnt = 0;
           return EOF;
       }
       return (unsigned char) *fp->ptr++;
   }
The only remaining loose end is how everything gets started. The array _iob must be defined
and initialized for stdin, stdout and stderr:

   FILE _iob[OPEN_MAX] = {    /* stdin, stdout, stderr */








       { 0, (char *) 0, (char *) 0, _READ, 0 },
       { 0, (char *) 0, (char *) 0, _WRITE, 1 },
       { 0, (char *) 0, (char *) 0, _WRITE, | _UNBUF, 2 }
   };
The initialization of the flag part of the structure shows that stdin is to be read, stdout is to
be written, and stderr is to be written unbuffered.

Exercise  8-2.  Rewrite  fopen  and  _fillbuf  with  fields  instead  of  explicit  bit  operations.
Compare code size and execution speed.

159

Exercise 8-3. Design and write _flushbuf, fflush, and fclose.

Exercise 8-4. The standard library function

   int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int origin)
is identical to lseek except that fp is a file pointer instead of a file descriptor and return value
is an int status, not a position. Write fseek. Make sure that your fseek coordinates properly
with the buffering done for the other functions of the library.

8.6 Example - Listing Directories

A different kind of file system interaction is sometimes called for - determining information
about a file, not what it contains. A directory-listing program such as the UNIX command ls
is an example - it prints the names of files in a directory, and, optionally, other information,
such as sizes, permissions, and so on. The MS-DOS dir command is analogous.

Since a UNIX directory is just a file, ls need only read it to retrieve the filenames. But is is
necessary  to  use  a  system  call  to  access  other  information  about  a  file,  such  as  its  size.  On
other systems, a system call may be needed even to access filenames; this is the case on MS-
DOS for instance. What we want is provide access to the information in a relatively system-
independent way, even though the implementation may be highly system-dependent.

We will illustrate some of this by writing a program called fsize. fsize is a special form of
ls that prints the sizes of all files named in its commandline argument list. If one of the files
is a directory,  fsize applies itself recursively to that directory. If there are no arguments at
all, it processes the current directory.

Let  us  begin  with  a  short  review  of  UNIX  file  system  structure.  A  directory  is  a  file  that
contains a list of filenames and some indication of where they are located. The "location" is
an  index  into  another  table  called  the  "inode  list."  The  inode  for  a  file  is  where  all
information about the file except its name is kept. A directory entry generally consists of only
two items, the filename and an inode number.

Regrettably, the format and precise contents of a directory are not the same on all versions of
the system. So we will divide the task into two pieces to try to isolate the non-portable parts.
The outer level defines a structure called a Dirent and three routines opendir, readdir, and
closedir to provide system-independent access to the name and inode number in a directory
entry. We will write fsize with this interface. Then we will show how to implement these on
systems that use the same directory structure as Version 7 and System V UNIX; variants are
left as exercises.




The  Dirent  structure  contains  the  inode  number  and  the  name.  The  maximum  length  of  a
filename  component  is  NAME_MAX,  which  is  a  system-dependent  value.  opendir  returns  a
pointer to a structure called DIR, analogous to FILE, which is used by readdir and closedir.
This information is collected into a file called dirent.h.

160

   #define NAME_MAX   14  /* longest filename component; */
                                  /* system-dependent */

   typedef struct {       /* portable directory entry */
       long ino;                  /* inode number */
       char name[NAME_MAX+1];     /* name + '\0' terminator */
   } Dirent;

   typedef struct {       /* minimal DIR: no buffering, etc. */
       int fd;               /* file descriptor for the directory */
       Dirent d;             /* the directory entry */
   } DIR;

   DIR *opendir(char *dirname);
   Dirent *readdir(DIR *dfd);
   void closedir(DIR *dfd);
The system call stat takes a filename and returns all of the information in the inode for that
file, or -1 if there is an error. That is,

   char *name;
   struct stat stbuf;
   int stat(char *, struct stat *);

   stat(name, &stbuf);
fills the structure stbuf with the inode information for the file name. The structure describing
the value returned by stat is in <sys/stat.h>, and typically looks like this:

   struct stat   /* inode information returned by stat */
   {
       dev_t     st_dev;      /* device of inode */
       ino_t     st_ino;      /* inode number */
       short     st_mode;     /* mode bits */
       short     st_nlink;    /* number of links to file */
       short     st_uid;      /* owners user id */
       short     st_gid;      /* owners group id */
       dev_t     st_rdev;     /* for special files */
       off_t     st_size;     /* file size in characters */
       time_t    st_atime;    /* time last accessed */
       time_t    st_mtime;    /* time last modified */
       time_t    st_ctime;    /* time originally created */
   };
Most of these values are explained by the comment fields. The types like  dev_t and  ino_t
are defined in <sys/types.h>, which must be included too.

The  st_mode  entry  contains  a  set  of  flags  describing  the  file.  The  flag  definitions  are  also
included in <sys/types.h>; we need only the part that deals with file type:

   #define S_IFMT    0160000  /* type of file: */
   #define S_IFDIR   0040000  /* directory */
   #define S_IFCHR   0020000  /* character special */
   #define S_IFBLK   0060000  /* block special */
   #define S_IFREG   0010000  /* regular */
   /* ... */











Now we are ready to write the program fsize. If the mode obtained from stat indicates that
a file is not a directory, then the size is at hand and can be printed directly. If the name is a
directory, however, then we have to process that directory one file at a time; it may in turn
contain sub-directories, so the process is recursive.

The main routine deals with command-line arguments; it hands each argument to the function
fsize.

161

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   #include "syscalls.h"
   #include <fcntl.h>      /* flags for read and write */
   #include <sys/types.h>  /* typedefs */
   #include <sys/stat.h>   /* structure returned by stat */
   #include "dirent.h"

   void fsize(char *)

   /* print file name */
   main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
       if (argc == 1)  /* default: current directory */
           fsize(".");
       else
           while (--argc > 0)
               fsize(*++argv);
       return 0;
   }
The function  fsize prints the size of the file. If the file is a directory, however, fsize first
calls dirwalk to handle all the files in it. Note how the flag names S_IFMT and S_IFDIR are
used to decide if the file is a directory. Parenthesization matters, because the precedence of &
is lower than that of ==.

   int stat(char *, struct stat *);
   void dirwalk(char *, void (*fcn)(char *));

   /* fsize:  print the name of file "name" */
   void fsize(char *name)
   {
       struct stat stbuf;

       if (stat(name, &stbuf) == -1) {
           fprintf(stderr, "fsize: can't access %s\n", name);
           return;
       }
       if ((stbuf.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR)
           dirwalk(name, fsize);
       printf("%8ld %s\n", stbuf.st_size, name);
   }
The function dirwalk is a general routine that applies a function to each file in a directory. It
opens the directory, loops through the files in it, calling the function on each, then closes the
directory  and  returns.  Since  fsize  calls  dirwalk  on  each  directory,  the  two  functions  call
each other recursively.

   #define MAX_PATH 1024

   /* dirwalk:  apply fcn to all files in dir */
   void dirwalk(char *dir, void (*fcn)(char *))
   {











162

       char name[MAX_PATH];
       Dirent *dp;
       DIR *dfd;

       if ((dfd = opendir(dir)) == NULL) {
           fprintf(stderr, "dirwalk: can't open %s\n", dir);
           return;
       }
       while ((dp = readdir(dfd)) != NULL) {
           if (strcmp(dp->name, ".") == 0
               || strcmp(dp->name, ".."))
               continue;    /* skip self and parent */
           if (strlen(dir)+strlen(dp->name)+2 > sizeof(name))
               fprintf(stderr, "dirwalk: name %s %s too long\n",
                   dir, dp->name);
           else {
               sprintf(name, "%s/%s", dir, dp->name);
               (*fcn)(name);
           }
       }
       closedir(dfd);
   }
Each call to readdir returns a pointer to information for the next file, or NULL when there are
no files left. Each directory always contains entries for itself, called ".", and its parent, "..";
these must be skipped, or the program will loop forever.

Down  to  this  last  level,  the  code  is  independent  of  how  directories  are  formatted.  The  next
step is to present minimal versions of opendir, readdir, and closedir for a specific system.
The following routines are for Version 7 and System V UNIX systems; they use the directory
information in the header <sys/dir.h>, which looks like this:

   #ifndef DIRSIZ
   #define DIRSIZ  14
   #endif
   struct direct {   /* directory entry */
       ino_t d_ino;           /* inode number */
       char  d_name[DIRSIZ];  /* long name does not have '\0' */
   };
Some  versions  of  the  system  permit  much  longer  names  and  have  a  more  complicated
directory structure.

The  type  ino_t  is  a  typedef  that  describes  the  index  into  the  inode  list.  It  happens  to  be
unsigned  short on the systems we use regularly, but this is not the sort of information to
embed in a program; it might be different on a different system, so the typedef is better. A
complete set of "system" types is found in <sys/types.h>.

opendir opens the directory, verifies that the file is a directory (this time by the system call
fstat,  which  is  like  stat  except  that  it  applies  to  a  file  descriptor),  allocates  a  directory
structure, and records the information:

   int fstat(int fd, struct stat *);

   /* opendir:  open a directory for readdir calls */
   DIR *opendir(char *dirname)
   {
       int fd;
       struct stat stbuf;







163

       DIR *dp;

       if ((fd = open(dirname, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1
        || fstat(fd, &stbuf) == -1
        || (stbuf.st_mode & S_IFMT) != S_IFDIR
        || (dp = (DIR *) malloc(sizeof(DIR))) == NULL)
            return NULL;
       dp->fd = fd;
       return dp;
   }
closedir closes the directory file and frees the space:

   /* closedir:  close directory opened by opendir */
   void closedir(DIR *dp)
   {
       if (dp) {
           close(dp->fd);
           free(dp);
       }
   }
Finally, readdir uses read to read each directory entry. If a directory slot is not currently in
use (because a file has been removed), the inode number is zero, and this position is skipped.
Otherwise, the inode number and name are placed in a static structure and a pointer to that
is returned to the user. Each call overwrites the information from the previous one.

   #include <sys/dir.h>   /* local directory structure */

   /* readdir:  read directory entries in sequence */
   Dirent *readdir(DIR *dp)
   {
       struct direct dirbuf;  /* local directory structure */
       static Dirent  d;      /* return: portable structure */

       while (read(dp->fd, (char *) &dirbuf, sizeof(dirbuf))
                       == sizeof(dirbuf)) {
           if (dirbuf.d_ino == 0) /* slot not in use */
               continue;
           d.ino = dirbuf.d_ino;
           strncpy(d.name, dirbuf.d_name, DIRSIZ);
           d.name[DIRSIZ] = '\0';  /* ensure termination */
           return &d;
       }
       return NULL;
   }
Although  the  fsize  program  is  rather  specialized,  it  does  illustrate  a  couple  of  important
ideas. First, many programs are not "system programs"; they merely use information that is
maintained by the operating system. For such programs, it is crucial that the representation of
the  information  appear  only  in  standard  headers,  and  that  programs  include  those  headers
instead of embedding the declarations in themselves. The second observation is that with care
it is possible to create an interface to system-dependent objects that is itself relatively system-
independent. The functions of the standard library are good examples.

Exercise 8-5. Modify the fsize program to print the other information contained in the inode
entry.

8.7 Example - A Storage Allocator

In
Chapter 5, we presented a vary limited stack-oriented storage allocator. The version that we
will now write is unrestricted. Calls to malloc and free may occur in any order; malloc calls








164

upon  the  operating  system  to  obtain  more  memory  as  necessary.  These  routines  illustrate
some  of  the  considerations  involved  in  writing  machine-dependent  code  in  a  relatively
machine-independent  way,  and  also  show  a  real-life  application  of  structures,  unions  and
typedef.

Rather  than  allocating  from  a  compiled-in  fixed-size  array,  malloc  will  request  space  from
the operating system as needed. Since other activities in the program may also request space
without calling this allocator, the space that malloc manages may not be contiguous. Thus its
free storage is kept as a list of free blocks. Each block contains a size, a pointer to the next
block, and the space itself. The blocks are kept in order of increasing storage address, and the
last block (highest address) points to the first.

When  a  request  is  made,  the  free  list  is  scanned  until  a  big-enough  block  is  found.  This
algorithm is called "first fit," by contrast with "best fit," which looks for the smallest block
that will satisfy the request. If the block is exactly the size requested it is unlinked from the
list  and  returned  to  the  user.  If  the  block  is  too  big,  it  is  split,  and  the  proper  amount  is
returned to the user while the residue remains on the free list. If no big-enough block is found,
another large chunk is obtained by the operating system and linked into the free list.

Freeing also causes a search of the free list, to find the proper place to insert the block being
freed. If the block being freed is adjacent to a free block on either side, it is coalesced with it
into  a  single  bigger  block,  so  storage  does  not  become  too  fragmented.  Determining  the
adjacency is easy because the free list is maintained in order of decreasing address.

One  problem,  which  we  alluded  to  in  Chapter  5,  is  to  ensure  that  the  storage  returned  by
malloc is aligned properly for the objects that will be stored in it. Although machines vary,
for each machine there is a most restrictive type: if the most restrictive type can be stored at a
particular address, all other types may be also. On some machines, the most restrictive type is
a double; on others, int or long suffices.

A free block contains a pointer to the next block in the chain, a record of the size of the block,
and then the free space itself; the control information at the beginning is called the "header."
To simplify alignment, all blocks are multiples of the header size, and the header is aligned
properly.  This  is  achieved  by  a  union  that  contains  the  desired  header  structure  and  an
instance of the most restrictive alignment type, which we have arbitrarily made a long:

   typedef long Align;    /* for alignment to long boundary */

   union header {         /* block header */






165

       struct {
           union header *ptr; /* next block if on free list */
           unsigned size;     /* size of this block */
       } s;
       Align x;           /* force alignment of blocks */
   };

   typedef union header Header;
The  Align  field  is  never  used;  it  just  forces  each  header  to  be  aligned  on  a  worst-case
boundary.

In malloc, the requested size in characters is rounded up to the proper number of header-sized
units; the block that will be allocated contains one more unit, for the header itself, and this is
the value recorded in the size field of the header. The pointer returned by malloc points at
the free space, not at the header itself. The user can do anything with the space requested, but
if anything is written outside of the allocated space the list is likely to be scrambled.

The size field is necessary because the blocks controlled by malloc need not be contiguous -
it is not possible to compute sizes by pointer arithmetic.

The variable base is used to get started. If freep is NULL, as it is at the first call of malloc,
then a degenerate free list is created; it contains one block of size zero, and points to itself. In
any case, the free list is then searched. The search for a free block of adequate size begins at
the  point  (freep)  where  the  last  block  was  found;  this  strategy  helps  keep  the  list
homogeneous. If a too-big block is found, the tail end is returned to the user; in this way the
header of the original needs only to have its size adjusted. In all cases, the pointer returned to
the user points to the free space within the block, which begins one unit beyond the header.

   static Header base;       /* empty list to get started */
   static Header *freep = NULL;     /* start of free list */

   /* malloc:  general-purpose storage allocator */
   void *malloc(unsigned nbytes)
   {
       Header *p, *prevp;
       Header *moreroce(unsigned);
       unsigned nunits;

       nunits = (nbytes+sizeof(Header)-1)/sizeof(header) + 1;
       if ((prevp = freep) == NULL) {   /* no free list yet */
           base.s.ptr = freeptr = prevptr = &base;
           base.s.size = 0;
       }








166

       for (p = prevp->s.ptr; ; prevp = p, p = p->s.ptr) {
           if (p->s.size >= nunits) {  /* big enough */
               if (p->s.size == nunits)  /* exactly */
                   prevp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr;
               else {              /* allocate tail end */
                   p->s.size -= nunits;
                   p += p->s.size;
                   p->s.size = nunits;
               }
               freep = prevp;
               return (void *)(p+1);
           }
           if (p == freep)  /* wrapped around free list */
               if ((p = morecore(nunits)) == NULL)
                   return NULL;    /* none left */
       }
   }
The function morecore obtains storage from the operating system. The details of how it does
this  vary  from  system  to  system.  Since  asking  the  system  for  memory  is  a  comparatively
expensive operation. we don't want to do that on every call to malloc, so morecore requests
al least  NALLOC units; this larger block will be chopped up as needed. After setting the size
field, morecore inserts the additional memory into the arena by calling free.

The UNIX system call sbrk(n) returns a pointer to n more bytes of storage. sbrk returns -1
if there was no space, even though NULL could have been a better design. The -1 must be cast
to  char  *  so  it  can  be  compared  with  the  return  value.  Again,  casts  make  the  function
relatively immune to the details of pointer representation on different machines. There is still
one  assumption,  however,  that  pointers  to  different  blocks  returned  by  sbrk  can  be
meaningfully  compared.  This  is  not  guaranteed  by  the  standard,  which  permits  pointer
comparisons  only  within  an  array.  Thus  this  version  of  malloc  is  portable  only  among
machines for which general pointer comparison is meaningful.

   #define NALLOC  1024   /* minimum #units to request */

   /* morecore:  ask system for more memory */
   static Header *morecore(unsigned nu)
   {
       char *cp, *sbrk(int);
       Header *up;

       if (nu < NALLOC)
           nu = NALLOC;
       cp = sbrk(nu * sizeof(Header));
       if (cp == (char *) -1)   /* no space at all */
           return NULL;
       up = (Header *) cp;
       up->s.size = nu;
       free((void *)(up+1));
       return freep;
   }
free  itself  is  the  last  thing.  It  scans  the  free  list,  starting  at  freep, looking for the place to
insert the free block. This is either between two existing blocks or at the end of the list. In any
case, if the block being freed is adjacent to either neighbor, the adjacent blocks are combined.
The only troubles are keeping the pointers pointing to the right things and the sizes correct.

   /* free:  put block ap in free list */
   void free(void *ap)
   {







167

       Header *bp, *p;

       bp = (Header *)ap - 1;    /* point to  block header */
       for (p = freep; !(bp > p && bp < p->s.ptr); p = p->s.ptr)
            if (p >= p->s.ptr && (bp > p || bp < p->s.ptr))
                break;  /* freed block at start or end of arena */

       if (bp + bp->size == p->s.ptr) {    /* join to upper nbr */
           bp->s.size += p->s.ptr->s.size;
           bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr->s.ptr;
       } else
           bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr;
       if (p + p->size == bp) {            /* join to lower nbr */
           p->s.size += bp->s.size;
           p->s.ptr = bp->s.ptr;
       } else
           p->s.ptr = bp;
       freep = p;
   }
Although storage allocation is intrinsically machine-dependent, the code above illustrates how
the machine dependencies can be controlled and confined to a very small part of the program.
The  use  of  typedef  and  union  handles  alignment  (given  that  sbrk  supplies  an  appropriate
pointer).  Casts  arrange  that  pointer  conversions  are  made  explicit,  and  even  cope  with  a
badly-designed  system  interface.  Even  though  the  details  here  are  related  to  storage
allocation, the general approach is applicable to other situations as well.

Exercise 8-6. The standard library function calloc(n,size) returns a pointer to n objects of
size  size,  with  the  storage  initialized  to  zero.  Write  calloc,  by  calling  malloc  or  by
modifying it.

Exercise 8-7.  malloc accepts a size request without checking its plausibility; free believes
that  the  block  it  is  asked  to  free  contains  a  valid  size  field.  Improve  these  routines  so  they
make more pains with error checking.

Exercise 8-8. Write a routine bfree(p,n) that will free any arbitrary block p of n characters
into the free list maintained by malloc and free. By using bfree, a user can add a static or
external array to the free list at any time.
