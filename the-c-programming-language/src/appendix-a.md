# A.1 Introduction

This  manual  describes  the  C  language  specified  by  the  draft  submitted  to  ANSI  on  31
October, 1988, for approval as "American Standard for Information Systems - programming
Language C, X3.159-1989." The manual is an interpretation of the proposed standard, not the
standard itself, although care has been taken to make it a reliable guide to the language.

For  the  most  part,  this  document  follows  the  broad  outline  of  the  standard,  which  in  turn
follows that of the first edition of this book, although the organization differs in detail. Except
for renaming a few productions, and not formalizing the definitions of the lexical tokens or
the preprocessor, the grammar given here for the language proper is equivalent to that of the
standard.

Throughout this manual, commentary material is indented and written in smaller type, as this is. Most
often these comments highlight ways in which ANSI Standard C differs from the language defined by
the first edition of this book, or from refinements subsequently introduced in various compilers.

# A.2 Lexical Conventions

A program consists of one or more translation units stored in files. It is translated in several
phases,  which  are  described
lexical
transformations, carry out directives introduced by the lines beginning with the # character,
and  perform  macro  definition  and  expansion.  When  the  preprocessing  of  Par.A.12  is
complete, the program has been reduced to a sequence of tokens.

in  Par.A.12.  The  first  phases  do

low-level

## A.2.1 Tokens

There are six classes of tokens: identifiers, keywords, constants, string literals, operators, and
other separators. Blanks, horizontal and vertical tabs, newlines, formfeeds and comments as
described  below  (collectively,  "white  space")  are  ignored  except  as  they  separate  tokens.
Some  white  space  is  required  to  separate  otherwise  adjacent  identifiers,  keywords,  and
constants.

If the input stream has been separated into tokens up to a given character, the next token is the
longest string of characters that could constitute a token.

## A.2.2 Comments

The characters /* introduce a comment, which terminates with the characters */. Comments
do not nest, and they do not occur within a string or character literals.

## A.2.3 Identifiers

An  identifier  is  a  sequence  of  letters  and  digits.  The  first  character  must  be  a  letter;  the
underscore  _  counts  as  a  letter.  Upper  and  lower  case  letters  are  different.  Identifiers  may
have  any  length,  and  for  internal  identifiers,  at  least  the  first  31  characters  are  significant;




some  implementations  may  take  more  characters  significant.  Internal  identifiers  include
preprocessor macro names and all other names that do not have external linkage (Par.A.11.2).
Identifiers with external linkage are more restricted: implementations may make as few as the
first six characters significant, and may ignore case distinctions.

169

## A.2.4 Keywords

The  following  identifiers  are  reserved  for  the  use  as  keywords,  and  may  not  be  used
otherwise:

     auto          double      int          struct
     break         else        long         switch
     case          enum        register     typedef
     char          extern      return       union
     const         float       short        unsigned
     continue      for         signed       void
     default       goto        sizeof       volatile
     do            if          static       while
Some implementations also reserve the words fortran and asm.

The keywords const, signed, and volatile are new with the ANSI standard; enum and void
are  new  since  the  first  edition,  but  in  common  use;  entry,  formerly  reserved  but  never  used,  is  no
longer reserved.

## A.2.5 Constants

There are several kinds of constants. Each has a data type; Par.A.4.2 discusses the basic types:

    constant:
      integer-constant
      character-constant
      floating-constant
      enumeration-constant

### A.2.5.1 Integer Constants

An integer constant consisting of a sequence of digits is taken to be octal if it begins with 0
(digit zero), decimal otherwise. Octal constants do not contain the digits 8 or 9. A sequence of
digits preceded by 0x or 0X (digit zero) is taken to be a hexadecimal integer. The hexadecimal
digits include a or A through f or F with values 10 through 15.

An integer constant may be suffixed by the letter u or U, to specify that it is unsigned. It may
also be suffixed by the letter l or L to specify that it is long.

The  type  of  an  integer  constant  depends  on  its  form,  value  and  suffix.  (See  Par.A.4  for  a
discussion of types). If it is unsuffixed and decimal, it has the first of these types in which its
value can be represented:  int,  long  int,  unsigned  long  int. If it is unsuffixed, octal or
hexadecimal,  it  has  the  first  possible  of  these  types:  int,  unsigned  int,  long  int,
unsigned long int. If it is suffixed by u or U, then unsigned int, unsigned long int. If
it is suffixed by l or L, then long int, unsigned long int. If an integer constant is suffixed
by UL, it is unsigned long.

The  elaboration  of  the  types  of  integer  constants  goes  considerably  beyond  the  first  edition,  which
merely caused large integer constants to be long. The U suffixes are new.




170

### A.2.5.2 Character Constants

A character constant is a sequence of one or more characters enclosed in single quotes as in
'x'.  The  value  of  a  character  constant  with  only  one  character  is  the  numeric  value  of  the
character  in  the  machine's  character  set  at  execution  time.  The  value  of  a  multi-character
constant is implementation-defined.

Character constants do not contain the ' character or newlines; in order to represent them, and
certain other characters, the following escape sequences may be used:

newline

NL (LF)  \n     backslash

horizontal tab   HT

vertical tab   VT

backspace

BS

carriage return  CR

formfeed

FF

audible alert   BEL

\t
\v
\b
\r
\f
\a

\   \\
question mark ?   \?
single quote   '   \'
double quote  "   \"
octal number  ooo \ooo
hex number   hh  \xhh

The escape \ooo consists of the backslash followed by 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, which are taken
to  specify  the  value  of  the  desired  character.  A  common  example  of  this  construction  is  \0
(not followed by a digit), which specifies the character NUL. The escape \xhh consists of the
backslash,  followed  by  x,  followed  by  hexadecimal  digits,  which  are  taken  to  specify  the
value of the desired character. There is no limit on the number of digits, but the behavior is
undefined if the resulting character value exceeds that of the largest character. For either octal
or  hexadecimal  escape  characters,  if  the  implementation  treats  the  char  type  as  signed,  the
value  is  sign-extended  as  if  cast  to  char  type.  If  the  character  following  the  \  is  not  one  of
those specified, the behavior is undefined.

In some implementations, there is an extended set of characters that cannot be represented in
the char type. A constant in this extended set is written with a preceding L, for example L'x',
and  is  called  a  wide  character  constant.  Such  a  constant  has  type  wchar_t, an integral type
defined  in  the  standard  header  <stddef.h>.  As  with  ordinary  character  constants,
hexadecimal escapes may be used; the effect is undefined if the specified value exceeds that
representable with wchar_t.

Some  of  these  escape  sequences  are  new,  in  particular  the  hexadecimal  character  representation.
Extended  characters  are  also  new.  The  character  sets  commonly  used  in  the  Americas  and  western
Europe  can  be  encoded  to  fit  in  the  char  type;  the  main  intent  in  adding  wchar_t  was  to
accommodate Asian languages.

### A.2.5.3 Floating Constants

A  floating  constant  consists  of  an  integer part, a decimal part, a fraction part, an  e or  E, an
optionally signed integer exponent and an optional type suffix, one of f, F, l, or L. The integer
and fraction parts both consist of a sequence of digits. Either the integer part, or the fraction
part (not both) may be missing; either the decimal point or the e and the exponent (not both)
may be missing. The type is determined by the suffix; F or f makes it float, L or l makes it
long double, otherwise it is double.

A2.5.4 Enumeration Constants






171

Identifiers declared as enumerators (see Par.A.8.4) are constants of type int.

## A.2.6 String Literals

A string literal, also called a string constant, is a sequence of characters surrounded by double
quotes  as  in  "...".  A  string  has  type  "array  of  characters"  and  storage  class  static  (see
Par.A.3  below)  and  is  initialized  with  the  given  characters.  Whether  identical  string  literals
are distinct is implementation-defined, and the behavior of a program that attempts to alter a
string literal is undefined.

Adjacent string literals are concatenated into a single string. After any concatenation, a null
byte \0 is appended to the string so that programs that scan the string can find its end. String
literals  do  not  contain  newline  or  double-quote  characters;  in  order  to  represent  them,  the
same escape sequences as for character constants are available.

As  with  character  constants,  string  literals  in  an  extended  character  set  are  written  with  a
preceding  L,  as  in  L"...".  Wide-character  string  literals  have  type  "array  of  wchar_t."
Concatenation of ordinary and wide string literals is undefined.

The specification that string literals need not be distinct, and the prohibition against modifying them,
are new in the ANSI standard, as is the concatenation of adjacent string literals. Wide-character string
literals are new.

# A.3 Syntax Notation

In  the  syntax  notation  used  in  this  manual,  syntactic  categories  are  indicated  by  italic  type,
and literal words and characters in typewriter style. Alternative categories are usually listed
on separate lines; in a few cases, a long set of narrow alternatives is presented on one line,
marked  by  the  phrase  "one  of."  An  optional  terminal  or  nonterminal  symbol  carries  the
subscript "opt," so that, for example,

{ expressionopt }

means an optional expression, enclosed in braces. The syntax is summarized in Par.A.13.

Unlike the grammar given in the first edition of this book, the one given here makes precedence and
associativity of expression operators explicit.

# A.4 Meaning of Identifiers

Identifiers,  or  names,  refer  to  a  variety  of  things:  functions;  tags  of  structures,  unions,  and
enumerations;  members  of  structures  or  unions;  enumeration  constants;  typedef  names;  and
objects. An object, sometimes called a variable, is a location in storage, and its interpretation
depends on two main attributes: its storage class and its type. The storage class determines the
lifetime of the storage associated with the identified object; the type determines the meaning
of the values found in the identified object. A name also has a scope, which is the region of
the program in which it is known, and a linkage, which determines whether the same name in
another  scope  refers  to  the  same  object  or  function.  Scope  and  linkage  are  discussed  in
Par.A.11.

## A.4.1 Storage Class



172

There  are  two  storage  classes:  automatic  and  static.  Several  keywords,  together  with  the
context  of  an  object's  declaration,  specify  its storage  class.  Automatic  objects  are  local  to  a
block (Par.9.3), and are discarded on exit from the block. Declarations within a block create
automatic  objects  if  no  storage  class  specification  is  mentioned,  or  if  the  auto  specifier  is
used. Objects declared register are automatic, and are (if possible) stored in fast registers of
the machine.

Static objects may be local to a block or external to all blocks, but in either case retain their
values across exit from and reentry to functions and blocks. Within a block, including a block
that  provides  the  code  for  a  function,  static  objects  are  declared  with  the  keyword  static.
The objects declared outside all blocks, at the same level as function definitions, are always
static. They may be made local to a particular translation unit by use of the static keyword;
this  gives  them  internal  linkage.  They  become  global  to  an  entire  program  by  omitting  an
explicit storage class, or by using the keyword extern; this gives them external linkage.

## A.4.2 Basic Types

There are several fundamental types. The standard header <limits.h> described in Appendix
B  defines  the  largest  and  smallest  values  of  each  type  in  the  local  implementation.  The
numbers given in Appendix B show the smallest acceptable magnitudes.

Objects declared as characters (char) are large enough to store any member of the execution
character  set.  If  a  genuine  character  from  that  set  is  stored  in  a  char  object,  its  value  is
equivalent to the integer code for the character, and is non-negative. Other quantities may be
stored into char variables, but the available range of values, and especially whether the value
is signed, is implementation-dependent.

Unsigned  characters  declared  unsigned  char  consume  the  same  amount  of  space  as  plain
characters,  but  always  appear  non-negative;  explicitly  signed  characters  declared  signed
char likewise take the same space as plain characters.

unsigned char type does not appear in the first edition of this book, but is in common use. signed
char is new.

Besides the char types, up to three sizes of integer, declared short int, int, and long int,
are  available.  Plain  int  objects  have  the  natural  size  suggested  by  the  host  machine
architecture;  the  other  sizes  are  provided  to  meet  special  needs.  Longer  integers  provide  at
least  as  much  storage  as  shorter  ones,  but  the  implementation  may  make  plain  integers
equivalent to either short integers, or long integers. The int types all represent signed values
unless specified otherwise.

Unsigned integers, declared using the keyword unsigned, obey the laws of arithmetic modulo
2n  where  n  is  the  number  of  bits  in  the  representation,  and  thus  arithmetic  on  unsigned
quantities can never overflow. The set of non-negative values that can be stored in a signed
object is a subset of the values that can be stored in the corresponding unsigned object, and
the representation for the overlapping values is the same.

Any of single precision floating point (float), double precision floating point (double), and
extra  precision  floating  point  (long  double) may be synonymous, but the ones later in the
list are at least as precise as those before.



173

long double is new. The first edition made long float equivalent to double; the locution has
been withdrawn.

Enumerations are unique types that have integral values; associated with each enumeration is
a set of named constants (Par.A.8.4). Enumerations behave like integers, but it is common for
a  compiler  to  issue  a  warning  when  an  object  of  a  particular  enumeration  is  assigned
something other than one of its constants, or an expression of its type.

Because  objects  of  these  types  can  be  interpreted  as  numbers,  they  will  be  referred  to  as
arithmetic  types.  Types  char,  and  int  of  all  sizes,  each  with  or  without  sign,  and  also
enumeration types, will collectively be called integral types. The types  float,  double, and
long double will be called floating types.

The  void type specifies an empty set of values. It is used as the type returned by functions
that generate no value.

## A.4.3 Derived types

Beside the basic types, there is a conceptually infinite class of derived types constructed from
the fundamental types in the following ways:

  arrays of objects of a given type;
  functions returning objects of a given type;
  pointers to objects of a given type;
  structures containing a sequence of objects of various types;
  unions capable of containing any of one of several objects of various types.

In general these methods of constructing objects can be applied recursively.

## A.4.4 Type Qualifiers

An object's type may have additional qualifiers. Declaring an object const announces that its
value  will  not  be  changed;  declaring  it  volatile  announces  that  it  has  special  properties
relevant to optimization. Neither qualifier affects the range of values or arithmetic properties
of the object. Qualifiers are discussed in Par.A.8.2.

# A.5 Objects and Lvalues

An Object is a named region of storage; an lvalue is an expression referring to an object. An
obvious example of an lvalue expression is an identifier with suitable type and storage class.
There are operators that yield lvalues, if E is an expression of pointer type, then *E is an lvalue
expression  referring  to  the  object  to  which  E  points.  The  name  "lvalue"  comes  from  the
assignment expression  E1  =  E2 in which the left operand  E1 must be an lvalue expression.
The discussion of each operator specifies whether it expects lvalue operands and whether it
yields an lvalue.

# A.6 Conversions

Some  operators  may,  depending  on  their  operands,  cause  conversion  of  the  value  of  an
operand from one type to another. This section explains the result to be expected from such



conversions.  Par.6.5  summarizes  the  conversions  demanded  by  most  ordinary  operators;  it
will be supplemented as required by the discussion of each operator.

174

## A.6.1 Integral Promotion

A  character,  a  short  integer,  or  an  integer  bit-field,  all  either  signed  or  not,  or  an  object  of
enumeration type, may be used in an expression wherever an integer may be used. If an int
can represent all the values of the original type, then the value is converted to int; otherwise
the value is converted to unsigned int. This process is called integral promotion.

## A.6.2 Integral Conversions

Any integer is converted to a given unsigned type by finding the smallest non-negative value
that  is  congruent  to  that  integer,  modulo  one  more  than  the  largest  value  that  can  be
represented in the unsigned type. In a two's complement representation, this is equivalent to
left-truncation if the bit pattern of the unsigned type is narrower, and to zero-filling unsigned
values and sign-extending signed values if the unsigned type is wider.

When any integer is converted to a signed type, the value is unchanged if it can be represented
in the new type and is implementation-defined otherwise.

## A.6.3 Integer and Floating

When a value of floating type is converted to integral type, the fractional part is discarded; if
the  resulting  value  cannot  be  represented  in  the  integral  type,  the  behavior  is  undefined.  In
particular, the result of converting negative floating values to unsigned integral types is not
specified.

When a value of integral type is converted to floating, and the value is in the representable
range  but  is  not  exactly  representable,  then  the  result  may  be  either  the  next  higher  or  next
lower representable value. If the result is out of range, the behavior is undefined.

## A.6.4 Floating Types

When a less precise floating value is converted to an equally or more precise floating type, the
value is unchanged. When a more precise floating value is converted to a less precise floating
type, and the value is within representable range, the result may be either the next higher or
the next lower representable value. If the result is out of range, the behavior is undefined.

## A.6.5 Arithmetic Conversions

Many  operators  cause  conversions  and  yield  result  types  in  a  similar  way.  The  effect  is  to
bring operands into a common type, which is also the type of the result. This pattern is called
the usual arithmetic conversions.

•  First, if either operand is long double, the other is converted to long double.
•  Otherwise, if either operand is double, the other is converted to double.
•  Otherwise, if either operand is float, the other is converted to float.
•  Otherwise,  the  integral  promotions  are  performed  on  both  operands;  then,  if  either
operand is unsigned long int, the other is converted to unsigned long int.



175

•  Otherwise,  if  one  operand  is  long  int  and  the  other  is  unsigned  int,  the  effect
depends on whether a long int can represent all values of an unsigned int; if so,
the  unsigned  int  operand  is  converted  to  long  int;  if  not,  both  are  converted  to
unsigned long int.

•  Otherwise, if one operand is long int, the other is converted to long int.
•  Otherwise,  if  either  operand  is  unsigned  int,  the  other  is  converted  to  unsigned

int.

•  Otherwise, both operands have type int.

There  are  two  changes  here.  First,  arithmetic  on  float  operands  may  be  done  in  single  precision,
rather than double; the first edition specified that all floating arithmetic was double precision. Second,
shorter  unsigned  types,  when  combined  with  a  larger  signed  type,  do  not  propagate  the  unsigned
property  to  the  result  type;  in  the  first  edition,  the  unsigned  always  dominated.  The  new  rules  are
slightly  more  complicated,  but  reduce  somewhat  the  surprises  that  may  occur  when  an  unsigned
quantity meets signed. Unexpected results may still occur when an unsigned expression is compared to
a signed expression of the same size.

## A.6.6 Pointers and Integers

An expression of integral type may be added to or subtracted from a pointer; in such a case
the  integral  expression  is  converted  as  specified  in  the  discussion  of  the  addition  operator
(Par.A.7.7).

Two pointers to objects of the same type, in the same array, may be subtracted; the result is
converted to an integer as specified in the discussion of the subtraction operator (Par.A.7.7).

An integral constant expression with value 0, or such an expression cast to type void *, may
be  converted,  by  a  cast,  by  assignment,  or  by  comparison,  to  a  pointer  of  any  type.  This
produces a null pointer that is equal to another null pointer of the same type, but unequal to
any pointer to a function or object.

Certain other conversions involving pointers are permitted, but have implementation-defined
aspects. They must be specified by an explicit type-conversion operator, or cast (Pars.A.7.5
and A.8.8).

A  pointer  may  be  converted  to  an  integral  type large enough to hold it; the required size is
implementation-dependent. The mapping function is also implementation-dependent.

A pointer to one type may be converted to a pointer to another type. The resulting pointer may
cause addressing exceptions if the subject pointer does not refer to an object suitably aligned
in  storage.  It  is  guaranteed  that  a  pointer  to  an  object  may  be  converted  to  a  pointer  to  an
object  whose  type  requires  less  or  equally  strict  storage  alignment  and  back  again  without
change; the notion of "alignment" is implementation-dependent, but objects of the char types
have  least  strict  alignment  requirements.  As  described  in  Par.A.6.8,  a  pointer  may  also  be
converted to type void * and back again without change.

A pointer may be converted to another pointer whose type is the same except for the addition
or removal of qualifiers (Pars.A.4.4, A.8.2) of the object type to which the pointer refers. If
qualifiers are added, the new pointer is equivalent to the old except for restrictions implied by
the  new  qualifiers.  If  qualifiers  are  removed,  operations  on  the  underlying  object  remain
subject to the qualifiers in its actual declaration.



Finally, a pointer to a function may be converted to a pointer to another function type. Calling
the function specified by the converted pointer is implementation-dependent; however, if the
converted  pointer  is  reconverted  to  its  original  type,  the  result  is  identical  to  the  original
pointer.

176

## A.6.7 Void

The (nonexistent) value of a void object may not be used in any way, and neither explicit nor
implicit conversion to any non-void type may be applied. Because a void expression denotes a
nonexistent value, such an expression may be used only where the value is not required, for
example  as  an  expression  statement  (Par.A.9.2)  or  as  the  left  operand  of  a  comma  operator
(Par.A.7.18).

An expression may be converted to type void by a cast. For example, a void cast documents
the discarding of the value of a function call used as an expression statement.

void did not appear in the first edition of this book, but has become common since.

## A.6.8 Pointers to Void

Any pointer to an object may be converted to type void * without loss of information. If the
result is converted back to the original pointer type, the original pointer is recovered. Unlike
the pointer-to-pointer conversions discussed in Par.A.6.6, which generally require an explicit
cast,  pointers  may  be  assigned  to  and  from  pointers  of  type  void  *, and may be compared
with them.

This interpretation of void * pointers is new; previously, char * pointers played the role of generic
pointer. The ANSI standard specifically blesses the meeting of void * pointers with object pointers in
assignments and relationals, while requiring explicit casts for other pointer mixtures.

# A.7 Expressions

The precedence of expression operators is the same as the order of the major subsections of
this  section,  highest  precedence  first.  Thus,  for  example,  the  expressions  referred  to  as  the
operands  of  +  (Par.A.7.7)  are  those  expressions  defined  in  Pars.A.7.1-A.7.6.  Within  each
subsection, the operators have the same precedence. Left- or right-associativity is specified in
each subsection for the operators discussed therein. The grammar given in Par.13 incorporates
the precedence and associativity of the operators.

The precedence and associativity of operators is fully specified, but the order of evaluation of
expressions  is,  with  certain  exceptions,  undefined,  even  if  the  subexpressions  involve  side
effects. That is, unless the definition of the operator guarantees that its operands are evaluated
in a particular order, the implementation is free to evaluate operands in any order, or even to
interleave  their  evaluation.  However,  each  operator  combines  the  values  produced  by  its
operands in a way compatible with the parsing of the expression in which it appears.

This rule revokes the previous freedom to reorder expressions with operators that are mathematically
commutative  and  associative,  but  can  fail  to  be  computationally  associative.  The  change  affects  only
floating-point computations near the limits of their accuracy, and situations where overflow is possible.

The handling of overflow, divide check, and other exceptions in expression evaluation is not
defined by the language. Most existing implementations of C ignore overflow in evaluation of
signed integral expressions and assignments, but this behavior is not guaranteed. Treatment of



division by 0, and all floating-point exceptions, varies among implementations; sometimes it
is adjustable by a non-standard library function.

177

## A.7.1 Pointer Conversion

If the type of an expression or subexpression is "array of T," for some type T, then the value
of the expression is a pointer to the first object in the array, and the type of the expression is
altered  to  "pointer  to  T."  This  conversion  does  not  take  place  if  the  expression  is  in  the
operand of the unary & operator, or of ++, --, sizeof, or as the left operand of an assignment
operator  or  the  .  operator.  Similarly,  an  expression  of  type  "function  returning  T,"  except
when used as the operand of the & operator, is converted to "pointer to function returning T."

A.7.2 Primary Expressions

Primary expressions are identifiers, constants, strings, or expressions in parentheses.

    primary-expression
      identifier
      constant
      string
      (expression)

An  identifier  is  a  primary  expression,  provided  it  has  been  suitably  declared  as  discussed
below. Its type is specified by its declaration. An identifier is an lvalue if it refers to an object
(Par.A.5) and if its type is arithmetic, structure, union, or pointer.

A constant is a primary expression. Its type depends on its form as discussed in Par.A.2.5.

A string literal is a primary expression. Its type is originally "array of char" (for wide-char
strings,  "array  of  wchar_t"),  but  following  the  rule  given  in  Par.A.7.1,  this  is  usually
modified to "pointer to char" (wchar_t) and the result is a pointer to the first character in the
string. The conversion also does not occur in certain initializers; see Par.A.8.7.

A  parenthesized  expression  is  a  primary  expression  whose  type  and  value  are  identical  to
those of the unadorned expression. The precedence of parentheses does not affect whether the
expression is an lvalue.

A.7.3 Postfix Expressions

The operators in postfix expressions group left to right.

    postfix-expression:
      primary-expression
      postfix-expression[expression]
      postfix-expression(argument-expression-listopt)

A.7.3.1 Array References

A  postfix  expression  followed  by  an  expression  in  square  brackets  is  a  postfix  expression
denoting a subscripted array reference. One of the two expressions must have type "pointer to
T",  where  T  is  some  type,  and  the  other  must  have  integral  type;  the  type  of  the  subscript
expression  is  T.  The  expression  E1[E2]  is  identical  (by  definition)  to  *((E1)+(E2)).  See
Par.A.8.6.2 for further discussion.

A.7.3.2 Function Calls

A function call is a postfix expression, called the function designator, followed by parentheses
containing  a  possibly  empty,  comma-separated  list  of  assignment  expressions  (Par.A7.17),
which  constitute  the  arguments  to  the  function.  If  the  postfix  expression  consists  of  an
identifier  for  which  no  declaration  exists  in  the  current  scope,  the  identifier  is  implicitly
declared as if the declaration

    extern int identifier();

had  been  given  in  the  innermost  block  containing  the  function  call.  The  postfix  expression
(after possible explicit declaration and pointer generation, Par.A7.1) must be of type "pointer
to function returning T," for some type T, and the value of the function call has type T.

In the first edition, the type was restricted to "function," and an explicit * operator was required to call
through  pointers  to  functions.  The  ANSI  standard  blesses  the  practice  of  some  existing  compilers  by
permitting  the  same  syntax  for  calls  to  functions  and  to  functions  specified  by  pointers.  The  older
syntax is still usable.

The term argument is used for an expression passed by a function call; the term parameter is
used for an input object (or its identifier) received by a function definition, or described in a
function  declaration.  The  terms  "actual  argument  (parameter)"  and  "formal  argument
(parameter)" respectively are sometimes used for the same distinction.

In preparing for the call to a function, a copy is made of each argument; all argument-passing
is  strictly  by  value.  A  function  may  change  the  values  of  its  parameter  objects,  which  are
copies  of  the  argument  expressions,  but  these  changes  cannot  affect  the  values  of  the
arguments.  However,  it  is  possible  to  pass  a  pointer  on  the  understanding  that  the  function
may change the value of the object to which the pointer points.

There  are  two  styles  in  which  functions  may  be  declared.  In  the  new  style,  the  types  of
parameters  are  explicit  and  are  part  of  the  type  of  the  function;  such  a  declaration  os  also
called  a  function  prototype.  In  the  old  style,  parameter  types  are  not  specified.  Function
declaration is issued in Pars.A.8.6.3 and A.10.1.

If the function declaration in scope for a call is old-style, then default argument promotion is
applied  to  each  argument  as  follows:  integral  promotion  (Par.A.6.1)  is  performed  on  each
argument of integral type, and each float argument is converted to double. The effect of the
call is undefined if the number of arguments disagrees with the number of parameters in the
definition of the function, or if the type of an argument after promotion disagrees with that of
the corresponding parameter. Type agreement depends on whether the function's definition is



179

new-style or old-style. If it is old-style, then the comparison is between the promoted type of
the  arguments  of  the  call,  and  the  promoted  type  of  the  parameter,  if  the  definition  is  new-
style,  the  promoted  type  of  the  argument  must  be  that  of  the  parameter  itself,  without
promotion.

If the function declaration in scope for a call is new-style, then the arguments are converted,
as if by assignment, to the types of the corresponding parameters of the function's prototype.
The number of arguments must be the same as the number of explicitly described parameters,
unless the declaration's parameter list ends with the ellipsis notation (, ...). In that case, the
number  of  arguments  must  equal  or  exceed  the  number  of  parameters;  trailing  arguments
beyond the explicitly typed parameters suffer default argument promotion as described in the
preceding  paragraph.  If  the  definition  of  the  function  is  old-style,  then  the  type  of  each
parameter  in  the  definition,  after  the  definition  parameter's  type  has  undergone  argument
promotion.

These  rules  are  especially  complicated  because  they  must  cater  to  a  mixture  of  old-  and  new-style
functions. Mixtures are to be avoided if possible.

The order of evaluation of arguments is unspecified; take note that various compilers differ.
However, the arguments and the function designator are completely evaluated, including all
side effects, before the function is entered. Recursive calls to any function are permitted.

A.7.3.3 Structure References

A postfix expression followed by a dot followed by an identifier is a postfix expression. The
first  operand  expression  must  be  a  structure  or  a  union,  and  the  identifier  must  name  a
member of the structure or union. The value is the named member of the structure or union,
and its type is the type of the member. The expression is an lvalue if the first expression is an
lvalue, and if the type of the second expression is not an array type.

A postfix expression followed by an arrow (built from - and >) followed by an identifier is a
postfix expression. The first operand expression must be a pointer to a structure or union, and
the identifier must name a member of the structure or union. The result refers to the named
member of the structure or union to which the pointer expression points, and the type is the
type of the member; the result is an lvalue if the type is not an array type.

Thus the expression E1->MOS is the same as (*E1).MOS. Structures and unions are discussed
in Par.A.8.3.

In the first edition of this book, it was already the rule that a member name in such an expression had to
belong to the structure or union mentioned in the postfix expression; however, a note admitted that this
rule was not firmly enforced. Recent compilers, and ANSI, do enforce it.

A.7.3.4 Postfix Incrementation

A postfix expression followed by a ++ or -- operator is a postfix expression. The value of the
expression is the value of the operand. After the value is noted, the operand is incremented ++
or  decremented  --  by  1.  The  operand  must  be  an  lvalue;  see  the  discussion  of  additive
operators (Par.A.7.7) and assignment (Par.A.7.17) for further constraints on the operand and
details of the operation. The result is not an lvalue.

A.7.4 Unary Operators



Expressions with unary operators group right-to-left.

180

    unary-expression:
      postfix expression
      ++unary expression
      --unary expression
      unary-operator cast-expression
      sizeof unary-expression
      sizeof(type-name)

    unary operator: one of
      & * + - ~ !

A.7.4.1 Prefix Incrementation Operators

A  unary  expression  followed  by  a  ++  or  --  operator  is  a  unary  expression.  The  operand  is
incremented  ++  or  decremented  --  by  1.  The  value  of  the  expression  is  the  value  after  the
incrementation  (decrementation).  The  operand  must  be  an  lvalue;  see  the  discussion  of
additive  operators  (Par.A.7.7)  and  assignment  (Par.A.7.17)  for  further  constraints  on  the
operands and details of the operation. The result is not an lvalue.

A.7.4.2 Address Operator

The unary operator & takes the address of its operand. The operand must be an lvalue referring
neither to a bit-field nor to an object declared as register, or must be of function type. The
result is a pointer to the object or function referred to by the lvalue. If the type of the operand
is T, the type of the result is "pointer to T."

A.7.4.3 Indirection Operator

The  unary  *  operator  denotes  indirection,  and  returns  the  object  or  function  to  which  its
operand points. It is an lvalue if the operand is a pointer to an object of arithmetic, structure,
union, or pointer type. If the type of the expression is "pointer to T," the type of the result is
T.

A.7.4.4 Unary Plus Operator

The operand of the unary + operator must have arithmetic type, and the result is the value of
the operand. An integral operand undergoes integral promotion. The type of the result is the
type of the promoted operand.

The unary + is new with the ANSI standard. It was added for symmetry with the unary -.

A.7.4.5 Unary Minus Operator

The operand of the unary - operator must have arithmetic type, and the result is the negative
of  its  operand.  An  integral  operand  undergoes  integral  promotion.  The  negative  of  an
unsigned quantity is computed by subtracting the promoted value from the largest value of the
promoted type and adding one; but negative zero is zero. The type of the result is the type of
the promoted operand.

A.7.4.6 One's Complement Operator



The operand of the ~ operator must have integral type, and the result is the one's complement
of its operand. The integral promotions are performed. If the operand is unsigned, the result is
computed by subtracting the value from the largest value of the promoted type. If the operand
is  signed,  the  result  is  computed  by  converting  the  promoted  operand  to  the  corresponding
unsigned type, applying ~, and converting back to the signed type. The type of the result is the
type of the promoted operand.

181

A.7.4.7 Logical Negation Operator

The operand of the ! operator must have arithmetic type or be a pointer, and the result is 1 if
the value of its operand compares equal to 0, and 0 otherwise. The type of the result is int.

A.7.4.8 Sizeof Operator

The sizeof operator yields the number of bytes required to store an object of the type of its
operand. The operand is either an expression, which is not evaluated, or a parenthesized type
name. When sizeof is applied to a char, the result is 1; when applied to an array, the result is
the total number of bytes in the array. When applied to a structure or union, the result is the
number of bytes in the object, including any padding required to make the object tile an array:
the size of an array of n elements is n times the size of one element. The operator may not be
applied to an operand of function type, or of incomplete type, or to a bit-field. The result is an
unsigned integral constant; the particular type is implementation-defined. The standard header
<stddef.h> (See appendix B) defines this type as size_t.

A.7.5 Casts

A  unary  expression  preceded  by  the  parenthesized name of a type causes conversion of the
value of the expression to the named type.

    cast-expression:
      unary expression
      (type-name) cast-expression

This  construction  is  called  a  cast.  The  names  are  described  in  Par.A.8.8.  The  effects  of
conversions are described in Par.A.6. An expression with a cast is not an lvalue.

A.7.6 Multiplicative Operators

The multiplicative operators *, /, and % group left-to-right.

    multiplicative-expression:
      multiplicative-expression * cast-expression
      multiplicative-expression / cast-expression
      multiplicative-expression % cast-expression

The operands of * and / must have arithmetic type; the operands of % must have integral type.
The usual arithmetic conversions are performed on the operands, and predict the type of the
result.

The binary * operator denotes multiplication.



The binary / operator yields the quotient, and the % operator the remainder, of the division of
the first operand by the second; if the second operand is 0, the result is undefined. Otherwise,
it is always true that (a/b)*b + a%b is equal to a. If both operands are non-negative, then the
remainder is non-negative and smaller than the divisor, if not, it is guaranteed only that the
absolute value of the remainder is smaller than the absolute value of the divisor.

182

A.7.7 Additive Operators

The  additive  operators  + and  - group left-to-right. If the operands have arithmetic type, the
usual arithmetic conversions are performed. There are some additional type possibilities for
each operator.

    additive-expression:
      multiplicative-expression
      additive-expression + multiplicative-expression
      additive-expression - multiplicative-expression

The result of the + operator is the sum of the operands. A pointer to an object in an array and a
value  of  any  integral  type  may  be  added.  The  latter  is  converted  to  an  address  offset  by
multiplying it by the size of the object to which the pointer points. The sum is a pointer of the
same type as the original pointer, and points to another object in the same array, appropriately
offset from the original object. Thus if P is a pointer to an object in an array, the expression
P+1 is a pointer to the next object in the array. If the sum pointer points outside the bounds of
the array, except at the first location beyond the high end, the result is undefined.

The provision for pointers just beyond the end of an array is new. It legitimizes a common idiom for
looping over the elements of an array.

The result of the - operator is the difference of the operands. A value of any integral type may
be  subtracted  from  a  pointer,  and  then  the  same  conversions  and  conditions  as  for  addition
apply.

If two pointers to objects of the same type are subtracted, the result is a signed integral value
representing the displacement between the pointed-to objects; pointers to successive objects
differ  by  1.  The  type  of  the  result  is  defined  as  ptrdiff_t  in  the  standard  header
<stddef.h>.  The  value  is  undefined  unless  the  pointers  point  to  objects  within  the  same
array; however, if P points to the last member of an array, then (P+1)-P has value 1.

A.7.8 Shift Operators

The  shift  operators  <<  and  >> group left-to-right. For both operators, each operand must be
integral,  and  is  subject  to  integral  the  promotions.  The  type  of  the  result  is  that  of  the
promoted left operand. The result is undefined if the right operand is negative, or greater than
or equal to the number of bits in the left expression's type.

    shift-expression:
      additive-expression
      shift-expression << additive-expression
      shift-expression >> additive-expression

The value of E1<<E2 is E1 (interpreted as a bit pattern) left-shifted E2 bits; in the absence of
overflow, this is equivalent to multiplication by 2E2. The value of E1>>E2 is E1 right-shifted



183
E2 bit positions. The right shift is equivalent to division by 2E2 if  E1 is unsigned or it has a
non-negative value; otherwise the result is implementation-defined.

A.7.9 Relational Operators

The  relational  operators  group  left-to-right,  but  this  fact  is  not  useful;  a<b<c  is  parsed  as
(a<b)<c, and evaluates to either 0 or 1.

    relational-expression:
      shift-expression
      relational-expression < shift-expression
      relational-expression > shift-expression
      relational-expression <= shift-expression
      relational-expression >= shift-expression

The operators < (less), > (greater), <= (less or equal) and >= (greater or equal) all yield 0 if the
specified relation is false and 1 if it is true. The type of the result is int. The usual arithmetic
conversions  are  performed  on  arithmetic  operands.  Pointers  to  objects  of  the  same  type
(ignoring any qualifiers) may be compared; the result depends on the relative locations in the
address  space  of  the  pointed-to  objects.  Pointer  comparison  is  defined  only  for  parts  of  the
same  object;  if  two  pointers  point  to  the  same  simple  object,  they  compare  equal;  if  the
pointers  are  to  members  of  the  same  structure,  pointers  to  objects  declared  later  in  the
structure  compare  higher;  if  the  pointers  refer  to  members  of  an  array,  the  comparison  is
equivalent to comparison of the the corresponding subscripts. If P points to the last member of
an  array,  then  P+1  compares  higher  than  P,  even  though  P+1  points  outside  the  array.
Otherwise, pointer comparison is undefined.

These  rules  slightly  liberalize  the  restrictions  stated  in  the  first  edition,  by  permitting  comparison  of
pointers to different members of a structure or union. They also legalize comparison with a pointer just
off the end of an array.

A.7.10 Equality Operators

    equality-expression:
      relational-expression
      equality-expression == relational-expression
      equality-expression != relational-expression

The == (equal to) and the != (not equal to) operators are analogous to the relational operators
except  for  their  lower  precedence.  (Thus  a<b  ==  c<d  is  1  whenever  a<b  and  c<d  have  the
same truth-value.)

The equality operators follow the same rules as the relational operators, but permit additional
possibilities: a pointer may be compared to a constant integral expression with value 0, or to a
pointer to void. See Par.A.6.6.

A.7.11 Bitwise AND Operator

    AND-expression:
      equality-expression
      AND-expression & equality-expression



The usual arithmetic conversions are performed; the result is the bitwise AND function of the
operands. The operator applies only to integral operands.

184

A.7.12 Bitwise Exclusive OR Operator

    exclusive-OR-expression:
      AND-expression
      exclusive-OR-expression ^ AND-expression

The  usual  arithmetic  conversions  are  performed;  the  result  is  the  bitwise  exclusive  OR
function of the operands. The operator applies only to integral operands.

A.7.13 Bitwise Inclusive OR Operator

    inclusive-OR-expression:
      exclusive-OR-expression
      inclusive-OR-expression | exclusive-OR-expression

The  usual  arithmetic  conversions  are  performed;  the  result  is  the  bitwise  inclusive  OR
function of the operands. The operator applies only to integral operands.

A.7.14 Logical AND Operator

    logical-AND-expression:
      inclusive-OR-expression
      logical-AND-expression && inclusive-OR-expression

The && operator groups left-to-right. It returns 1 if both its operands compare unequal to zero,
0  otherwise.  Unlike  &,  &&  guarantees  left-to-right  evaluation:  the  first  operand  is  evaluated,
including all side effects; if it is equal to 0, the value of the expression is 0. Otherwise, the
right operand is evaluated, and if it is equal to 0, the expression's value is 0, otherwise 1.

The operands need not have the same type, but each must have arithmetic type or be a pointer.
The result is int.

A.7.15 Logical OR Operator

    logical-OR-expression:
      logical-AND-expression
      logical-OR-expression || logical-AND-expression

The || operator groups left-to-right. It returns 1 if either of its operands compare unequal to
zero,  and  0  otherwise.  Unlike  |,  ||  guarantees  left-to-right  evaluation:  the  first  operand  is
evaluated,  including  all  side  effects;  if  it  is  unequal  to  0,  the  value  of  the  expression  is  1.
Otherwise, the right operand is evaluated, and if it is unequal to 0, the expression's value is 1,
otherwise 0.

The operands need not have the same type, but each must have arithmetic type or be a pointer.
The result is int.

A.7.16 Conditional Operator



185

    conditional-expression:
      logical-OR-expression
      logical-OR-expression ? expression : conditional-expression

The  first  expression  is  evaluated,  including  all  side  effects;  if  it  compares unequal to 0, the
result is the value of the second expression, otherwise that of the third expression. Only one of
the  second  and  third  operands  is  evaluated.  If  the  second  and  third  operands  are  arithmetic,
the usual arithmetic conversions are performed to bring them to a common type, and that type
is the type of the result. If both are void, or structures or unions of the same type, or pointers
to objects of the same type, the result has the common type. If one is a pointer and the other
the constant 0, the 0 is converted to the pointer type, and the result has that type. If one is a
pointer to void and the other is another pointer, the other pointer is converted to a pointer to
void, and that is the type of the result.

In the type comparison for pointers, any type qualifiers (Par.A.8.2) in the type to which the
pointer  points  are  insignificant,  but  the  result  type  inherits  qualifiers  from  both  arms  of  the
conditional.

A.7.17 Assignment Expressions

There are several assignment operators; all group right-to-left.

    assignment-expression:
      conditional-expression
      unary-expression assignment-operator assignment-expression

    assignment-operator: one of
      = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=

All  require  an  lvalue  as  left  operand,  and  the  lvalue  must  be  modifiable:  it  must  not  be  an
array,  and  must  not  have  an  incomplete  type,  or  be  a  function.  Also,  its  type  must  not  be
qualified with const; if it is a structure or union, it must not have any member or, recursively,
submember  qualified  with  const.  The  type  of  an  assignment  expression  is  that  of  its  left
operand, and the value is the value stored in the left operand after the assignment has taken
place.

In  the  simple  assignment  with  =,  the  value  of  the  expression  replaces  that  of  the  object
referred to by the lvalue. One of the following must be true: both operands have arithmetic
type, in which case the right operand is converted to the type of the left by the assignment; or
both operands are structures or unions of the same type; or one operand is a pointer and the
other is a pointer to void, or the left operand is a pointer and the right operand is a constant
expression with value 0; or both operands are pointers to functions or objects whose types are
the same except for the possible absence of const or volatile in the right operand.

An expression of the form E1  op=  E2 is equivalent to  E1  =  E1  op  (E2) except that E1 is
evaluated only once.

A.7.18 Comma Operator

    expression:
      assignment-expression
      expression , assignment-expression



A pair of expressions separated by a comma is evaluated left-to-right, and the value of the left
expression is discarded. The type and value of the result are the type and value of the right
operand.  All  side  effects  from  the  evaluation  of  the  left-operand  are  completed  before
beginning  the  evaluation  of  the  right  operand.  In  contexts  where  comma  is  given  a  special
meaning,  for  example  in  lists  of  function  arguments  (Par.A.7.3.2)  and  lists  of  initializers
(Par.A.8.7),  the  required  syntactic  unit  is  an  assignment  expression,  so  the  comma  operator
appears only in a parenthetical grouping, for example,

186

   f(a, (t=3, t+2), c)
has three arguments, the second of which has the value 5.

A.7.19 Constant Expressions

Syntactically, a constant expression is an expression restricted to a subset of operators:

    constant-expression:
      conditional-expression

Expressions that evaluate to a constant are required in several contexts: after case, as array
bounds  and  bit-field  lengths,  as  the  value  of  an  enumeration  constant,  in  initializers,  and  in
certain preprocessor expressions.

Constant  expressions  may  not  contain  assignments,  increment  or  decrement  operators,
function  calls,  or  comma  operators;  except  in  an  operand  of  sizeof.  If  the  constant
expression  is  required  to  be  integral,  its  operands  must  consist  of  integer,  enumeration,
character,  and  floating  constants;  casts  must  specify  an  integral  type,  and  any  floating
constants  must  be  cast  to  integer.  This  necessarily  rules  out  arrays,  indirection,  address-of,
and structure member operations. (However, any operand is permitted for sizeof.)

More  latitude  is  permitted  for  the  constant  expressions  of  initializers;  the  operands  may  be
any type of constant, and the unary & operator may be applied to external or static objects, and
to external and static arrays subscripted with a constant expression. The unary & operator can
also  be  applied  implicitly  by  appearance  of  unsubscripted  arrays  and  functions.  Initializers
must evaluate either to a constant or to the address of a previously declared external or static
object plus or minus a constant.

Less latitude is allowed for the integral constant expressions after  #if;  sizeof expressions,
enumeration constants, and casts are not permitted. See Par.A.12.5.

A.8 Declarations

Declarations specify the interpretation given to each identifier; they do not necessarily reserve
storage associated with the identifier. Declarations that reserve storage are called definitions.
Declarations have the form

    declaration:
      declaration-specifiers init-declarator-listopt;

The  declarators  in  the  init-declarator  list  contain  the  identifiers  being  declared;  the
declaration-specifiers consist of a sequence of type and storage class specifiers.




187

    declaration-specifiers:
      storage-class-specifier declaration-specifiersopt
      type-specifier declaration-specifiersopt
      type-qualifier declaration-specifiersopt

    init-declarator-list:
      init-declarator
      init-declarator-list , init-declarator

    init-declarator:
      declarator
      declarator = initializer

Declarators  will  be  discussed  later  (Par.A.8.5);  they  contain  the  names  being  declared.  A
declaration must have at least one declarator, or its type specifier must declare a structure tag,
a union tag, or the members of an enumeration; empty declarations are not permitted.

A.8.1 Storage Class Specifiers

The storage class specifiers are:

    storage-class specifier:
      auto
      register
      static
      extern
      typedef

The meaning of the storage classes were discussed in Par.A.4.4.

The auto and register specifiers give the declared objects automatic storage class, and may
be used only within functions. Such declarations also serve as definitions and cause storage to
be reserved. A  register declaration is equivalent to an  auto declaration, but hints that the
declared  objects  will  be  accessed  frequently.  Only  a  few  objects  are  actually  placed  into
registers,  and  only  certain  types  are  eligible;  the  restrictions  are  implementation-dependent.
However,  if  an  object  is  declared  register,  the  unary  &  operator  may  not  be  applied  to  it,
explicitly or implicitly.

The rule that it is illegal to calculate the address of an object declared register, but actually taken to
be auto, is new.

The  static specifier gives the declared objects static storage class, and may be used either
inside or outside functions. Inside a function, this specifier causes storage to be allocated, and
serves as a definition; for its effect outside a function, see Par.A.11.2.

A declaration with extern, used inside a function, specifies that the storage for the declared
objects is defined elsewhere; for its effects outside a function, see Par.A.11.2.

The typedef specifier does not reserve storage and is called a storage class specifier only for
syntactic convenience; it is discussed in Par.A.8.9.



At most one storage class specifier may be given in a declaration. If none is given, these rules
are used: objects declared inside a function are taken to be auto; functions declared within a
function are taken to be extern; objects and functions declared outside a function are taken to
be static, with external linkage. See Pars. A.10-A.11.

188

A.8.2 Type Specifiers

The type-specifiers are

    type specifier:
      void
      char
      short
      int
      long
      float
      double
      signed
      unsigned
      struct-or-union-specifier
      enum-specifier
      typedef-name

At most one of the words long or short may be specified together with int; the meaning is
the same if int is not mentioned. The word long may be specified together with double. At
most one of signed or unsigned may be specified together with int or any of its short or
long varieties, or with char. Either may appear alone in which case int is understood. The
signed  specifier  is  useful  for  forcing  char  objects  to  carry  a  sign;  it  is  permissible  but
redundant with other integral types.

Otherwise,  at  most  one  type-specifier may be given in a declaration. If the type-specifier is
missing from a declaration, it is taken to be int.

Types may also be qualified, to indicate special properties of the objects being declared.

    type-qualifier:
      const
      volatile

Type qualifiers may appear with any type specifier. A const object may be initialized, but not
thereafter  assigned  to.  There  are  no  implementation-dependent  semantics  for  volatile
objects.

The const and volatile properties are new with the ANSI standard. The purpose of const is to
announce  objects  that  may  be  placed  in  read-only  memory,  and  perhaps  to  increase  opportunities  for
optimization.  The  purpose  of  volatile is to force an implementation to suppress optimization that
could otherwise occur. For example, for a machine with memory-mapped input/output, a pointer to a
device  register  might  be  declared  as  a  pointer  to  volatile,  in  order  to  prevent  the  compiler  from
removing apparently redundant references through the pointer. Except that it should diagnose explicit
attempts to change const objects, a compiler may ignore these qualifiers.

A.8.3 Structure and Union Declarations



A structure is an object consisting of a sequence of named members of various types. A union
is  an  object  that  contains,  at  different  times,  any  of  several  members  of  various  types.
Structure and union specifiers have the same form.

189

    struct-or-union-specifier:
      struct-or-union identifieropt{ struct-declaration-list }
      struct-or-union identifier

    struct-or-union:
      struct
      union

A  struct-declaration-list  is  a  sequence  of  declarations  for  the  members  of  the  structure  or
union:

    struct-declaration-list:
      struct declaration
      struct-declaration-list struct declaration

    struct-declaration:       specifier-qualifier-list struct-declarator-list;

    specifier-qualifier-list:
      type-specifier specifier-qualifier-listopt
      type-qualifier specifier-qualifier-listopt

    struct-declarator-list:
      struct-declarator
      struct-declarator-list , struct-declarator

Usually,  a  struct-declarator  is  just  a  declarator  for  a  member  of  a  structure  or  union.  A
structure member may also consist of a specified number of bits. Such a member is also called
a bit-field; its length is set off from the declarator for the field name by a colon.

    struct-declarator:
      declarator       declaratoropt : constant-expression

A type specifier of the form

    struct-or-union identifier { struct-declaration-list }

declares the identifier to be the tag of the structure or union specified by the list. A subsequent
declaration  in  the  same  or  an  inner  scope  may  refer  to  the  same  type  by  using  the  tag  in  a
specifier without the list:

    struct-or-union identifier

If a specifier with a tag but without a list appears when the tag is not declared, an incomplete
type  is  specified.  Objects  with  an  incomplete  structure  or  union  type  may  be  mentioned  in
contexts  where  their  size  is  not  needed,  for  example  in  declarations  (not  definitions),  for
specifying a pointer, or for creating a typedef, but not otherwise. The type becomes complete
on occurrence of a subsequent specifier with that tag, and containing a declaration list. Even



in  specifiers  with  a  list,  the  structure  or  union  type  being  declared  is  incomplete  within  the
list, and becomes complete only at the } terminating the specifier.

A  structure  may  not  contain  a  member  of  incomplete  type.  Therefore,  it  is  impossible  to
declare a structure or union containing an instance of itself. However, besides giving a name
to the structure or union type, tags allow definition of self-referential structures; a structure or
union may contain a pointer to an instance of itself, because pointers to incomplete types may
be declared.

190

A very special rule applies to declarations of the form

    struct-or-union identifier;

that declare a structure or union, but have no declaration list and no declarators. Even if the
identifier  is  a  structure  or  union  tag  already  declared  in  an  outer  scope  (Par.A.11.1),  this
declaration makes the identifier the tag of a new, incompletely-typed structure or union in the
current scope.

This recondite is new with ANSI. It is intended to deal with mutually-recursive structures declared in an
inner scope, but whose tags might already be declared in the outer scope.

A structure or union specifier with a list but no tag creates a unique type; it can be referred to
directly only in the declaration of which it is a part.

The names of members and tags do not conflict with each other or with ordinary variables. A
member  name  may  not  appear  twice  in  the  same  structure  or  union,  but  the  same  member
name may be used in different structures or unions.

In  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  the  names  of  structure  and  union  members  were  not  associated  with
their parent. However, this association became common in compilers well before the ANSI standard.

A non-field member of a structure or union may have any object type. A field member (which
need  not  have  a  declarator  and  thus  may  be  unnamed)  has  type  int,  unsigned  int,  or
signed  int,  and  is  interpreted  as  an  object  of  integral  type  of  the  specified  length  in  bits;
whether  an  int  field  is  treated  as  signed  is  implementation-dependent.  Adjacent  field
members  of  structures  are  packed  into  implementation-dependent  storage  units  in  an
implementation-dependent direction. When a field following another field will not fit into a
partially-filled  storage  unit,  it  may  be  split  between  units,  or  the  unit  may  be  padded.  An
unnamed field with width 0 forces this padding, so that the next field will begin at the edge of
the next allocation unit.

The ANSI standard makes fields even more implementation-dependent than did the first edition. It is
advisable  to  read  the  language  rules  for  storing  bit-fields  as  "implementation-dependent"  without
qualification.  Structures  with  bit-fields  may  be  used  as  a  portable  way  of  attempting  to  reduce  the
storage  required  for  a  structure  (with  the  probable  cost  of  increasing  the  instruction  space,  and  time,
needed  to  access  the  fields),  or  as  a  non-portable  way  to  describe  a  storage  layout  known  at  the  bit-
level. In the second case, it is necessary to understand the rules of the local implementation.

The  members  of  a  structure  have  addresses  increasing  in  the  order  of  their  declarations.  A
non-field member of a structure is aligned at an addressing boundary depending on its type;
therefore, there may be unnamed holes in a structure. If a pointer to a structure is cast to the
type of a pointer to its first member, the result refers to the first member.



A union may be thought of as a structure all of whose members begin at offset 0 and whose
size is sufficient to contain any of its members. At most one of the members can be stored in a
union at any time. If a pointr to a union is cast to the type of a pointer to a member, the result
refers to that member.

191

A simple example of a structure declaration is

   struct tnode {
       char tword[20];
       int count;
       struct tnode *left;
       struct tnode *right;
   }
which  contains  an  array  of  20  characters,  an  integer,  and  two  pointers  to  similar  structures.
Once this declaration has bene given, the declaration

   struct tnode s, *sp;
declares s to be a structure of the given sort, and sp to be a pointer to a structure of the given
sort. With these declarations, the expression

   sp->count
refers to the count field of the structure to which sp points;

   s.left
refers to the left subtree pointer of the structure s, and

   s.right->tword[0]
refers to the first character of the tword member of the right subtree of s.

In general, a member of a union may not be inspected unless the value of the union has been
assigned  using  the  same  member.  However,  one  special  guarantee  simplifies  the  use  of
unions:  if  a  union  contains  several  structures  that  share  a  common  initial  sequence,  and  the
union currently contains one of these structures, it is permitted to refer to the common initial
part of any of the contained structures. For example, the following is a legal fragment:

   union {
       struct {
           int type;
       } n;
       struct {
           int type;
           int intnode;
       } ni;
       struct {
           int type;
           float floatnode;
       } nf;
   } u;
   ...
   u.nf.type = FLOAT;
   u.nf.floatnode = 3.14;
   ...
   if (u.n.type == FLOAT)
       ... sin(u.nf.floatnode) ...

A.8.4 Enumerations









Enumerations  are  unique  types  with  values  ranging  over  a  set  of  named  constants  called
enumerators.  The  form  of  an  enumeration  specifier  borrows  from  that  of  structures  and
unions.

192

    enum-specifier:
      enum identifieropt { enumerator-list }
      enum identifier

    enumerator-list:
      enumerator
      enumerator-list , enumerator

    enumerator:
      identifier
      identifier = constant-expression

The  identifiers  in  an  enumerator  list  are  declared  as  constants  of  type  int,  and  may  appear
wherever  constants  are  required.  If  no  enumerations  with  =  appear,  then  the  values  of  the
corresponding  constants  begin  at  0  and  increase  by  1  as  the  declaration  is  read  from  left  to
right.  An  enumerator  with  =  gives  the  associated  identifier  the  value  specified;  subsequent
identifiers continue the progression from the assigned value.

Enumerator names in the same scope must all be distinct from each other and from ordinary
variable names, but the values need not be distinct.

The role of the identifier in the enum-specifier is analogous to that of the structure tag in a
struct-specifier;  it  names  a  particular  enumeration.  The  rules  for  enum-specifiers  with  and
without  tags  and  lists  are  the  same  as  those  for  structure  or  union  specifiers,  except  that
incomplete  enumeration  types  do  not  exist;  the  tag  of  an  enum-specifier  without  an
enumerator list must refer to an in-scope specifier with a list.

Enumerations are new since the first edition of this book, but have been part of the language for some
years.

A.8.5 Declarators

Declarators have the syntax:

    declarator:
      pointeropt direct-declarator

    direct-declarator:
      identifier
      (declarator)
      direct-declarator [ constant-expressionopt ]
      direct-declarator ( parameter-type-list )
      direct-declarator ( identifier-listopt )

    pointer:
      * type-qualifier-listopt
      * type-qualifier-listopt pointer



193

    type-qualifier-list:
      type-qualifier
      type-qualifier-list type-qualifier

The structure of declarators resembles that of indirection, function, and array expressions; the
grouping is the same.

A.8.6 Meaning of Declarators

A  list  of  declarators  appears  after  a  sequence  of  type  and  storage  class  specifiers.  Each
declarator declares a unique main identifier, the one that appears as the first alternative of the
production for direct-declarator. The storage class specifiers apply directly to this identifier,
but  its  type  depends  on  the  form  of  its  declarator.  A  declarator  is  read  as  an  assertion  that
when  its  identifier  appears  in  an  expression  of  the  same  form  as  the  declarator,  it  yields  an
object of the specified type.

Considering  only  the  type  parts  of  the  declaration  specifiers  (Par.  A.8.2)  and  a  particular
declarator, a declaration has the form "T D," where T is a type and D is a declarator. The type
attributed to the identifier in the various forms of declarator is described inductively using this
notation.

In a declaration T D where D is an unadored identifier, the type of the identifier is T.

In a declaration T D where D has the form

      ( D1 )
then the type of the identifier in D1 is the same as that of D. The parentheses do not alter the
type, but may change the binding of complex declarators.

A.8.6.1 Pointer Declarators

In a declaration T D where D has the form

    * type-qualifier-listopt D1

and  the  type  of  the  identifier  in  the  declaration  T  D1  is  "type-modifier  T,"  the  type  of  the
identifier of D is "type-modifier type-qualifier-list pointer to T." Qualifiers following * apply
to pointer itself, rather than to the object to which the pointer points.

For example, consider the declaration

      int *ap[];
Here,  ap[]  plays  the  role  of  D1; a declaration "int  ap[]" (below) would give  ap the type
"array of int," the type-qualifier list is empty, and the type-modifier is "array of." Hence the
actual declaration gives ap the type "array to pointers to int."

As other examples, the declarations

      int i, *pi, *const cpi = &i;
      const int ci = 3, *pci;






declare an integer i and a pointer to an integer pi. The value of the constant pointer cpi may
not be changed; it will always point to the same location, although the value to which it refers
may  be  altered.  The  integer  ci  is  constant,  and  may  not  be  changed  (though  it  may  be
initialized,  as  here.)  The  type  of  pci  is  "pointer  to  const  int,"  and  pci  itself  may  be
changed  to  point  to  another  place,  but  the  value  to  which  it  points  may  not  be  altered  by
assigning through pci.

194

A.8.6.2 Array Declarators

In a declaration T D where D has the form

    D1 [constant-expressionopt]

and  the  type  of  the  identifier  in  the  declaration  T  D1  is  "type-modifier  T,"  the  type  of  the
identifier of D is "type-modifier array of T." If the constant-expression is present, it must have
integral  type,  and  value  greater  than  0.  If  the  constant  expression  specifying  the  bound  is
missing, the array has an incomplete type.

An  array  may  be  constructed  from  an  arithmetic  type,  from  a  pointer,  from  a  structure  or
union, or from another array (to generate a multi-dimensional array). Any type from which an
array is constructed must be complete; it must not be an array of structure of incomplete type.
This implies that for a multi-dimensional array, only the first dimension may be missing. The
type of an object of incomplete aray type is completed by another, complete, declaration for
the object (Par.A.10.2), or by initializing it (Par.A.8.7). For example,

      float fa[17], *afp[17];
declares an array of float numbers and an array of pointers to float numbers. Also,

      static int x3d[3][5][7];
declares a static three-dimensional array of integers, with rank 3 X 5 X 7. In complete detail,
x3d is an array of three items: each item is an array of five arrays; each of the latter arrays is
an array of seven integers. Any of the expressions  x3d,  x3d[i],  x3d[i][j],  x3d[i][j][k]
may reasonably appear in an expression. The first three have type "array,", the last has type
int.  More  specifically,  x3d[i][j]  is  an  array  of  7  integers,  and  x3d[i]  is  an  array  of  5
arrays of 7 integers.

The  array  subscripting  operation  is  defined  so  that  E1[E2]  is  identical  to  *(E1+E2).
Therefore,  despite  its  asymmetric  appearance,  subscripting  is  a  commutative  operation.
Because of the conversion rules that apply to + and to arrays (Pars.A6.6, A.7.1, A.7.7), if E1 is
an array and E2 an integer, then E1[E2] refers to the E2-th member of E1.

In the example, x3d[i][j][k] is equivalent to *(x3d[i][j] + k). The first subexpression
x3d[i][j] is converted by Par.A.7.1 to type "pointer to array of integers," by Par.A.7.7, the
addition involves multiplication by the size of an integer. It follows from the rules that arrays
are stored by rows (last subscript varies fastest) and that the first subscript in the declaration
helps  determine  the  amount  of  storage  consumed  by  an  array,  but  plays  no  other  part  in
subscript calculations.

A.8.6.3 Function Declarators

In a new-style function declaration T D where D has the form





    D1 (parameter-type-list)

and  the  type  of  the  identifier  in  the  declaration  T  D1  is  "type-modifier  T,"  the  type  of  the
identifier of D is "type-modifier function with arguments parameter-type-list returning T."

195

The syntax of the parameters is

    parameter-type-list:
      parameter-list
      parameter-list , ...

    parameter-list:
      parameter-declaration
      parameter-list , parameter-declaration

    parameter-declaration:
      declaration-specifiers declarator
      declaration-specifiers abstract-declaratoropt

In  the  new-style  declaration,  the  parameter  list  specifies  the  types  of  the  parameters.  As  a
special case, the declarator for a new-style function with no parameters has a parameter list
consisting soley of the keyword void. If the parameter list ends with an ellipsis ", ...", then
the function may accept more arguments than the number of parameters explicitly described,
see Par.A.7.3.2.

The types of parameters that are arrays or functions are altered to pointers, in accordance with
the rules for parameter conversions; see Par.A.10.1. The only storage class specifier permitted
in  a  parameter's  declaration  is  register,  and  this  specifier  is  ignored  unless  the  function
declarator  heads  a  function  definition.  Similarly,  if  the  declarators  in  the  parameter
declarations contain identifiers and the function declarator does not head a function definition,
the  identifiers  go  out  of  scope  immediately.  Abstract  declarators,  which  do  not  mention  the
identifiers, are discussed in Par.A.8.8.

In an old-style function declaration T D where D has the form

    D1(identifier-list

opt)

and  the  type  of  the  identifier  in  the  declaration  T  D1  is  "type-modifier  T,"  the  type  of  the
identifier  of  D  is  "type-modifier  function  of  unspecified  arguments  returning  T."  The
parameters (if present) have the form

    identifier-list:
      identifier
      identifier-list , identifier

In the old-style declarator, the identifier list must be absent unless the declarator is used in the
head of a function definition (Par.A.10.1). No information about the types of the parameters is
supplied by the declaration.

For example, the declaration




      int f(), *fpi(), (*pfi)();
declares a function f returning an integer, a function fpi returning a pointer to an integer, and
a  pointer  pfi  to  a  function  returning  an  integer.  In  none  of  these  are  the  parameter  types
specified; they are old-style.

196

In the new-style declaration

      int strcpy(char *dest, const char *source), rand(void);
strcpy is a function returning int, with two arguments, the first a character pointer, and the
second a pointer to constant characters. The parameter names are effectively comments. The
second function rand takes no arguments and returns int.

Function  declarators  with  parameter  prototypes  are,  by  far,  the  most  important  language  change
introduced by the ANSI standard. They offer an advantage over the "old-style" declarators of the first
edition  by  providing  error-detection  and  coercion  of  arguments  across  function  calls,  but  at  a  cost:
turmoil and confusion during their introduction, and the necessity of accomodating both forms. Some
syntactic  ugliness  was  required  for  the  sake  of  compatibility,  namely  void  as  an  explicit  marker  of
new-style functions without parameters.

The ellipsis notation ", ..." for variadic functions is also new, and, together with the macros in the
standard header <stdarg.h>, formalizes a mechanism that was officially forbidden but unofficially
condoned in the first edition.

These notations were adapted from the C++ language.

A.8.7 Initialization

When  an  object  is  declared,  its  init-declarator  may  specify  an  initial  value  for  the  identifier
being  declared.  The  initializer  is  preceded  by  =,  and  is  either  an  expression,  or  a  list  of
initializers nested in braces. A list may end with a comma, a nicety for neat formatting.

    initializer:
      assignment-expression
      { initializer-list }
      { initializer-list , }

    initializer-list:
      initializer
      initializer-list , initializer

All the expressions in the initializer for a static object or array must be constant expressions as
described in Par.A.7.19. The expressions in the initializer for an auto or register object or
array must likewise be constant expressions if the initializer is a brace-enclosed list. However,
if  the  initializer  for  an  automatic  object  is  a  single  expression,  it  need  not  be  a  constant
expression, but must merely have appropriate type for assignment to the object.

The first edition did not countenance initialization of automatic structures, unions, or arrays. The ANSI
standard allows it, but only by constant constructions unless the initializer can be expressed by a simple
expression.

A static object not explicitly initialized is initialized as if it (or its members) were assigned the
constant 0. The initial value of an automatic object not explicitly intialized is undefined.




197

The initializer for a pointer or an object of arithmetic type is a single expression, perhaps in
braces. The expression is assigned to the object.

The initializer for a structure is either an expression of the same type, or a brace-enclosed list
of initializers for its members in order. Unnamed bit-field members are ignored, and are not
initialized. If there are fewer initializers in the list than members of the structure, the trailing
members are initialized with 0. There may not be more initializers than members. Unnamed
bit-field members are ignored,and are not initialized.

The initializer for an array is a brace-enclosed list of initializers for its members. If the array
has  unknown  size,  the  number  of  initializers  determines  the  size  of  the  array,  and  its  type
becomes complete. If the array has fixed size, the number of initializers may not exceed the
number of members of the array; if there are fewer, the trailing members are initialized with
0.

As a special case, a character array may be initialized by a string literal; successive characters
of  the  string  initialize  successive  members  of  the  array.  Similarly,  a  wide  character  literal
(Par.A.2.6)  may  initialize  an  array  of  type  wchar_t.  If  the  array  has  unknown  size,  the
number  of  characters  in  the  string,  including  the  terminating  null  character,  determines  its
size; if its size is fixed, the number of characters in the string, not counting the terminating
null character, must not exceed the size of the array.

The initializer for a union is either a single expression of the same type, or a brace-enclosed
initializer for the first member of the union.

The first edition did not allow initialization of unions. The "first-member" rule is clumsy, but is hard to
generalize without new syntax. Besides allowing unions to be explicitly initialized in at least a primitive
way, this ANSI rule makes definite the semantics of static unions not explicitly initialized.

An aggregate is a structure or array. If an aggregate contains members of aggregate type, the
initialization rules apply recursively. Braces may be elided in the initialization as follows: if
the  initializer  for  an  aggregate's  member  that  itself is an aggregate begins with a left brace,
then  the  succeding  comma-separated  list  of  initializers  initializes  the  members  of  the
subaggregate; it is erroneous for there to be more initializers than members. If, however, the
initializer for a subaggregate does not begin with a left brace, then only enough elements from
the list are taken into account for the members of the subaggregate; any remaining members
are left to initialize the next member of the aggregate of which the subaggregate is a part.

For example,

   int x[] = { 1, 3, 5 };
declares  and  initializes  x  as  a  1-dimensional  array  with  three  members,  since  no  size  was
specified and there are three initializers.

   float y[4][3] = {
       { 1, 3, 5 },
       { 2, 4, 6 },
       { 3, 5, 7 },
   };
is a completely-bracketed initialization: 1, 3 and 5 initialize the first row of the array  y[0],
namely  y[0][0],  y[0][1],  and  y[0][2].  Likewise  the  next  two  lines  initialize  y[1]  and
y[2].  The  initializer  ends  early,  and  therefore  the  elements  of  y[3]  are  initialized  with  0.
Precisely the same effect could have been achieved by





198

   float y[4][3] = {
       1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7
   };
The  initializer  for  y  begins  with  a  left  brace,  but  that  for  y[0]  does  not;  therefore  three
elements from the list are used. Likewise the next three are taken successively for y[1] and
for y[2]. Also,

   float y[4][3] = {
       { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 }
   };
initializes the first column of y (regarded as a two-dimensional array) and leaves the rest 0.

Finally,

   char msg[] = "Syntax error on line %s\n";
shows  a  character  array  whose  members  are  initialized  with  a  string;  its  size  includes  the
terminating null character.

A.8.8 Type names

In  several  contexts  (to  specify  type  conversions  explicitly  with  a  cast,  to  declare  parameter
types in function declarators, and as argument of sizeof) it is necessary to supply the name
of a data type. This is accomplished using a type name, which is syntactically a declaration for
an object of that type omitting the name of the object.

    type-name:
      specifier-qualifier-list abstract-declaratoropt

    abstract-declarator:
      pointer
      pointeropt direct-abstract-declarator

    direct-abstract-declarator:
      ( abstract-declarator )
      direct-abstract-declaratoropt [constant-expressionopt]
      direct-abstract-declaratoropt (parameter-type-listopt)

It is possible to identify uniquely the location in the abstract-declarator where the identifier
would appear if the construction were a declarator in a declaration. The named type is then the
same as the type of the hypothetical identifier. For example,

   int
   int *
   int *[3]
   int (*)[]
   int *()
   int (*[])(void)
name respectively the types "integer," "pointer to integer," "array of 3 pointers to integers,"
"pointer to an unspecified number of integers," "function of unspecified parameters returning
pointer  to  integer,"  and  "array,  of  unspecified  size,  of  pointers  to  functions  with  no
parameters each returning an integer."







A.8.9 Typedef

Declarations  whose  storage  class  specifier  is  typedef  do  not  declare  objects;  instead  they
define identifiers that name types. These identifiers are called typedef names.

199

    typedef-name:
      identifier

A typedef declaration attributes a type to each name among its declarators in the usual way
(see  Par.A.8.6).  Thereafter,  each  such  typedef  name  is  syntactically  equivalent  to  a  type
specifier keyword for the associated type.

For example, after

   typedef long Blockno, *Blockptr;
   typedef struct { double r, theta; } Complex;
the constructions

   Blockno b;
   extern Blockptr bp;
   Complex z, *zp;
are legal declarations. The type of b is long, that of bp is "pointer to long," and that of z is
the specified structure; zp is a pointer to such a structure.

typedef  does  not  introduce  new  types,  only  synonyms  for  types  that  could  be  specified  in
another way. In the example, b has the same type as any long object.

Typedef names may be redeclared in an inner scope, but a non-empty set of type specifiers
must be given. For example,

   extern Blockno;
does not redeclare Blockno, but

   extern int Blockno;
does.

A.8.10 Type Equivalence

Two type specifier lists are equivalent if they contain the same set of type specifiers, taking
into account that some specifiers can be implied by others (for example, long alone implies
long int). Structures, unions, and enumerations with different tags are distinct, and a tagless
union, structure, or enumeration specifies a unique type.

Two types are the same if their abstract declarators (Par.A.8.8), after expanding any typedef
types, and deleting any function parameter specifiers, are the same up to the equivalence of
type specifier lists. Array sizes and function parameter types are significant.

A.9 Statements

Except as described, statements are executed in sequence. Statements are executed for their
effect, and do not have values. They fall into several groups.







200

    statement:
      labeled-statement
      expression-statement
      compound-statement
      selection-statement
      iteration-statement
      jump-statement

A.9.1 Labeled Statements

Statements may carry label prefixes.

    labeled-statement:
      identifier : statement
      case constant-expression : statement
      default : statement

A label consisting of an identifier declares the identifier. The only use of an identifier label is
as  a  target  of  goto.  The  scope  of  the  identifier  is  the  current  function.  Because  labels  have
their own name space, they do not interfere with other identifiers and cannot be redeclared.
See Par.A.11.1.

Case labels and default labels are used with the  switch statement (Par.A.9.4). The constant
expression of case must have integral type.

Labels themselves do not alter the flow of control.

A.9.2 Expression Statement

Most statements are expression statements, which have the form

    expression-statement:
      expressionopt;

Most  expression  statements  are  assignments  or  function  calls.  All  side  effects  from  the
expression are completed before the next statement is executed. If the expression is missing,
the  construction  is  called  a  null  statement;  it  is  often  used  to  supply  an  empty  body  to  an
iteration statement to place a label.

A.9.3 Compound Statement

So that several statements can be used where one is expected, the compound statement (also
called "block") is provided. The body of a function definition is a compound statement.

    compound-statement:
      { declaration-listopt statement-listopt }

    declaration-list:
      declaration
      declaration-list declaration



201

    statement-list:
      statement
      statement-list statement

If an identifier in the declaration-list was in scope outside the block, the outer declaration is
suspended  within  the  block  (see  Par.A.11.1),  after  which  it  resumes  its  force.  An  identifier
may  be  declared  only  once  in  the  same  block.  These  rules  apply  to  identifiers  in  the  same
name space (Par.A.11); identifiers in different name spaces are treated as distinct.

Initialization of automatic objects is performed each time the block is entered at the top, and
proceeds  in  the  order  of  the  declarators.  If  a  jump  into  the  block  is  executed,  these
initializations  are  not  performed.  Initialization  of  static  objects  are  performed  only  once,
before the program begins execution.

A.9.4 Selection Statements

Selection statements choose one of several flows of control.

    selection-statement:
      if (expression) statement
      if (expression) statement else statement
      switch (expression) statement

In both forms of the if statement, the expression, which must have arithmetic or pointer type,
is evaluated, including all side effects, and if it compares unequal to 0, the first substatement
is  executed.  In  the  second  form,  the  second  substatement is executed if the expression is 0.
The else ambiguity is resolved by connecting an else with the last encountered else-less if
at the same block nesting level.

The switch statement causes control to be transferred to one of several statements depending
on the value of an expression, which must have integral type. The substatement controlled by
a switch is typically compound. Any statement within the substatement may be labeled with
one or more case labels (Par.A.9.1). The controlling expression undergoes integral promotion
(Par.A.6.1), and the case constants are converted to the promoted type. No two of these case
constants associated with the same switch may have the same value after conversion. There
may also be at most one default label associated with a switch. Switches may be nested; a
case or default label is associated with the smallest switch that contains it.

When the switch statement is executed, its expression is evaluated, including all side effects,
and compared with each case constant. If one of the case constants is equal to the value of the
expression,  control  passes  to  the  statement  of  the  matched  case  label.  If  no  case  constant
matches  the  expression,  and  if  there  is  a  default  label,  control  passes  to  the  labeled
statement. If no case matches, and if there is no default, then none of the substatements of
the swtich is executed.

In  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  the  controlling  expression  of  switch,  and  the  case  constants,  were
required to have int type.

A.9.5 Iteration Statements

Iteration statements specify looping.



202

    iteration-statement:
      while (expression) statement
      do statement while (expression);
      for (expressionopt; expressionopt; expressionopt) statement

In the while and do statements, the substatement is executed repeatedly so long as the value
of the expression remains unequal to 0; the expression must have arithmetic or pointer type.
With  while,  the  test,  including  all  side  effects  from  the  expression,  occurs  before  each
execution of the statement; with do, the test follows each iteration.

In the for statement, the first expression is evaluated once, and thus specifies initialization for
the loop. There is no restriction on its type. The second expression must have arithmetic or
pointer  type;  it  is  evaluated  before  each  iteration,  and  if  it  becomes  equal  to  0,  the  for  is
terminated.  The  third  expression  is  evaluated  after  each  iteration,  and  thus  specifies  a  re-
initialization for the loop. There is no restriction on its type. Side-effects from each expression
are  completed  immediately  after  its  evaluation.  If  the  substatement  does  not  contain
continue, a statement

    for (expression1; expression2; expression3) statement

is equivalent to

expression1;
while (expression2) {
    statement
    expression3;
}
Any  of  the  three  expressions  may  be  dropped.  A  missing  second  expression  makes  the
implied test equivalent to testing a non-zero element.

A.9.6 Jump statements

Jump statements transfer control unconditionally.

    jump-statement:
      goto identifier;
      continue;
      break;
      return expressionopt;

In  the  goto  statement,  the  identifier  must  be  a  label  (Par.A.9.1)  located  in  the  current
function. Control transfers to the labeled statement.

A continue statement may appear only within an iteration statement. It causes control to pass
to  the  loop-continuation  portion  of  the  smallest  enclosing  such  statement.  More  precisely,
within each of the statements

   while (...) {       do {                 for (...) {
     ...                 ...                  ...
   contin: ;           contin: ;            contin: ;
   }                   } while (...);       }





203

a continue not contained in a smaller iteration statement is the same as goto contin.

A  break  statement  may  appear  only  in  an  iteration  statement  or  a  switch  statement,  and
terminates execution of the smallest enclosing such statement; control passes to the statement
following the terminated statement.

A  function  returns  to  its  caller  by  the  return  statement.  When  return  is  followed  by  an
expression, the value is returned to the caller of the function. The expression is converted, as
by assignment, to the type returned by the function in which it appears.

Flowing off the end of a function is equivalent to a return with no expression. In either case,
the returned value is undefined.

A.10 External Declarations

The  unit  of  input  provided  to  the  C  compiler  is  called  a  translation  unit;  it  consists  of  a
sequence of external declarations, which are either declarations or function definitions.

    translation-unit:
      external-declaration
      translation-unit external-declaration

    external-declaration:
      function-definition
      declaration

The scope of external declarations persists to the end of the translation unit in which they are
declared, just as the effect of declarations within the blocks persists to the end of the block.
The syntax of external declarations is the same as that of all declarations, except that only at
this level may the code for functions be given.

A.10.1 Function Definitions

Function definitions have the form

    function-definition:
      declaration-specifiersopt declarator declaration-listopt compound-statement

The  only  storage-class  specifiers  allowed  among  the  declaration  specifiers  are  extern  or
static; see Par.A.11.2 for the distinction between them.

A function may return an arithmetic type, a structure, a union, a pointer, or  void, but not a
function or an array. The declarator in a function declaration must specify explicitly that the
declared  identifier  has  function  type;  that  is,  it  must  contain  one  of  the  forms  (see
Par.A.8.6.3).

      direct-declarator ( parameter-type-list )
      direct-declarator ( identifier-listopt )

where the direct-declarator is an identifier or a parenthesized identifier. In particular, it must
not achieve function type by means of a typedef.



204

In the first form, the definition is a new-style function, and its parameters, together with their
types,  are  declared  in  its  parameter  type  list;  the  declaration-list  following  the  function's
declarator must be absent. Unless the parameter type list consists solely of void, showing that
the function takes no parameters, each declarator in the parameter type list must contain an
identifier. If the parameter type list ends with ", ..." then the function may be called with
more  arguments  than  parameters;  the  va_arg  macro  mechanism  defined  in  the  standard
header  <stdarg.h>  and  described  in  Appendix  B  must  be  used  to  refer  to  the  extra
arguments. Variadic functions must have at least one named parameter.

In the second form, the definition is old-style: the identifier list names the parameters, while
the declaration list attributes types to them. If no declaration is given for a parameter, its type
is  taken  to  be  int.  The  declaration  list  must  declare  only  parameters  named  in  the  list,
initialization is not permitted, and the only storage-class specifier possible is register.

In both styles of function definition, the parameters are understood to be declared just after
the beginning of the compound statement constituting the function's body, and thus the same
identifiers  must  not  be  redeclared  there  (although  they  may,  like  other  identifiers,  be
redeclared  in  inner  blocks).  If  a  parameter  is  declared  to  have  type  "array  of  type,"  the
declaration is adjusted to read "pointer to type;" similarly, if a parameter is declared to have
type  "function  returning  type,"  the  declaration  is  adjusted  to  read  "pointer  to  function
returning type." During the call to a function, the arguments are converted as necessary and
assigned to the parameters; see Par.A.7.3.2.

New-style  function  definitions  are  new  with  the  ANSI  standard.  There  is  also  a  small  change  in  the
details of promotion; the first edition specified that the declarations of float parameters were adjusted
to read double. The difference becomes noticable when a pointer to a parameter is generated within a
function.

A complete example of a new-style function definition is

   int max(int a, int b, int c)
   {
       int m;

       m = (a > b) ? a : b;
       return (m > c) ? m : c;
   }
Here  int  is  the  declaration  specifier;  max(int  a,  int  b,  int  c)  is  the  function's
declarator, and { ... } is the block giving the code for the function. The corresponding old-
style definition would be

   int max(a, b, c)
   int a, b, c;
   {
       /* ... */
   }
where now int max(a, b, c) is the declarator, and int a, b, c; is the declaration list for
the parameters.

A.10.2 External Declarations

External declarations specify the characteristics of objects, functions and other identifiers. The
term "external" refers to their location outside functions, and is not directly connected with






205

the extern keyword; the storage class for an externally-declared object may be left empty, or
it may be specified as extern or static.

Several external declarations for the same identifier may exist within the same translation unit
if they agree in type and linkage, and if there is at most one definition for the identifier.

Two  declarations  for  an  object  or  function  are  deemed  to  agree  in  type  under  the  rule
discussed  in  Par.A.8.10.  In  addition,  if  the  declarations  differ  because  one  type  is  an
incomplete  structure,  union,  or  enumeration  type  (Par.A.8.3)  and  the  other  is  the
corresponding completed type with the same tag, the types are taken to agree. Moreover, if
one type is an incomplete array type (Par.A.8.6.2) and the other is a completed array type, the
types, if otherwise identical, are also taken to agree. Finally, if one type specifies an old-style
function, and the other an otherwise identical new-style function, with parameter declarations,
the types are taken to agree.

If  the  first  external  declarator  for  a  function  or  object  includes  the  static  specifier,  the
identifier  has  internal  linkage;  otherwise  it  has  external  linkage.  Linkage  is  discussed  in
Par.11.2.

An external declaration for an object is a definition if it has an initializer. An external object
declaration that does not have an initializer, and does not contain the  extern specifier, is a
tentative  definition.  If  a  definition  for  an  object  appears  in  a  translation  unit,  any  tentative
definitions are treated merely as redundant declarations. If no definition for the object appears
in the translation unit, all its tentative definitions become a single definition with initializer 0.

Each  object  must  have  exactly  one  definition.  For  objects  with  internal  linkage,  this  rule
applies  separately  to  each  translation  unit,  because  internally-linked  objects  are  unique  to  a
translation unit. For objects with external linkage, it applies to the entire program.

Although the one-definition rule is formulated somewhat differently in the first edition of this book, it is
in effect identical to the one stated here. Some implementations relax it by generalizing the notion of
tentative definition. In the alternate formulation, which is usual in UNIX systems and recognized as a
common  extension  by  the  Standard,  all  the  tentative  definitions  for  an  externally  linked  object,
throughout all the translation units of the program, are considered together instead of in each translation
unit separately. If a definition occurs somewhere in the program, then the tentative definitions become
merely  declarations,  but  if  no  definition  appears,  then all its tentative definitions become a definition
with initializer 0.

A.11 Scope and Linkage

A program need not all be compiled at one time: the source text may be kept in several files
containing  translation  units,  and  precompiled  routines  may  be  loaded  from  libraries.
Communication among the functions of a program may be carried out both through calls and
through manipulation of external data.

Therefore,  there  are  two  kinds  of  scope  to  consider:  first,  the  lexical  scope  of  an  identifier
which  is  the  region  of  the  program  text  within  which  the  identifier's  characteristics  are
understood; and second, the scope associated with objects and functions with external linkage,
which determines the connections between identifiers in separately compiled translation units.

A.11.1 Lexical Scope



206

Identifiers  fall  into  several  name  spaces  that  do  not  interfere  with  one  another;  the  same
identifier  may  be  used  for  different  purposes,  even  in  the  same  scope,  if  the  uses  are  in
different  name  spaces.  These  classes  are:  objects,  functions,  typedef  names,  and  enum
constants;  labels;  tags  of  structures  or  unions,  and  enumerations;  and  members  of  each
structure or union individually.

These rules differ in several ways from those described in the first edition of this manual. Labels did not
previously have their own name space; tags of structures and unions each had a separate space, and in
some implementations enumerations tags did as well; putting different kinds of tags into the same space
is a new restriction. The most important departure from the first edition is that each structure or union
creates a separate name space for its members, so that the same name may appear in several different
structures. This rule has been common practice for several years.

The lexical scope of an object or function identifier in an external declaration begins at the
end  of  its  declarator  and  persists  to  the  end  of  the  translation  unit  in  which  it  appears.  The
scope  of  a  parameter  of  a  function  definition  begins  at  the  start  of  the  block  defining  the
function, and persists through the function; the scope of a parameter in a function declaration
ends at the end of the declarator. The scope of an identifier declared at the head of a block
begins at the end of its declarator, and persists to the end of the block. The scope of a label is
the whole of the function in which it appears. The scope of a structure, union, or enumeration
tag, or an enumeration constant, begins at its appearance in a type specifier, and persists to the
end of a translation unit (for declarations at the external level) or to the end of the block (for
declarations within a function).

If an identifier is explicitly declared at the head of a block, including the block constituting a
function, any declaration of the identifier outside the block is suspended until the end of the
block.

A.11.2 Linkage

Within  a  translation  unit,  all  declarations  of  the  same  object  or  function  identifier  with
internal linkage refer to the same thing, and the object or function is unique to that translation
unit. All declarations for the same object or function identifier with external linkage refer to
the same thing, and the object or function is shared by the entire program.

As discussed in Par.A.10.2, the first external declaration for an identifier gives the identifier
internal linkage if the static specifier is used, external linkage otherwise. If a declaration for
an identifier within a block does not include the extern specifier, then the identifier has no
linkage and is unique to the function. If it does include extern, and an external declaration
for is active in the scope surrounding the block, then the identifier has the same linkage as the
external declaration, and refers to the same object or function; but if no external declaration is
visible, its linkage is external.

A.12 Preprocessing

A preprocessor performs macro substitution, conditional compilation, and inclusion of named
files.  Lines  beginning  with  #,  perhaps  preceded  by  white  space,  communicate  with  this
preprocessor. The syntax of these lines is independent of the rest of the language; they may
appear  anywhere  and  have  effect  that  lasts  (independent  of  scope)  until  the  end  of  the
translation  unit.  Line  boundaries  are  significant;  each  line  is  analyzed  individually  (bus  see
Par.A.12.2 for how to adjoin lines). To the preprocessor, a token is any language token, or a
character sequence giving a file name as in the #include directive (Par.A.12.4); in addition,



any character not otherwise defined is taken as a token. However, the effect of white spaces
other than space and horizontal tab is undefined within preprocessor lines.

Preprocessing itself takes place in several logically successive phases that may, in a particular
implementation, be condensed.

207

1.  First, trigraph sequences as described in Par.A.12.1 are replaced by their equivalents.
Should the operating system environment require it, newline characters are introduced
between the lines of the source file.

2.  Each  occurrence  of  a  backslash  character  \  followed  by  a  newline  is  deleted,  this

splicing lines (Par.A.12.2).

3.  The  program  is  split  into  tokens  separated  by  white-space  characters;  comments  are
replaced  by  a  single  space.  Then  preprocessing  directives  are  obeyed,  and  macros
(Pars.A.12.3-A.12.10) are expanded.

4.  Escape  sequences  in  character  constants  and  string  literals  (Pars.  A.2.5.2,  A.2.6)  are

replaced by their equivalents; then adjacent string literals are concatenated.

5.  The  result  is  translated,  then  linked  together  with  other  programs  and  libraries,  by
collecting  the  necessary  programs  and  data,  and  connecting  external  functions  and
object references to their definitions.

A.12.1 Trigraph Sequences

The character set of C source programs is contained within seven-bit ASCII, but is a superset
of the ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code Set. In order to enable programs to be represented in the
reduced  set,  all  occurrences  of  the  following  trigraph  sequences  are  replaced  by  the
corresponding single character. This replacement occurs before any other processing.

         ??=  #            ??(  [            ??<  {
         ??/  \            ??)  ]            ??>  }
         ??'  ^            ??!  |            ??-  ~
No other such replacements occur.

Trigraph sequences are new with the ANSI standard.

A.12.2 Line Splicing

Lines  that  end  with  the  backslash  character  \  are  folded  by  deleting  the  backslash  and  the
following newline character. This occurs before division into tokens.

A.12.3 Macro Definition and Expansion

A control line of the form

    # define identifier token-sequence

causes  the  preprocessor  to  replace  subsequent  instances  of  the  identifier  with  the  given
sequence of tokens; leading and trailing white space around the token sequence is discarded.
A  second  #define  for  the  same  identifier  is  erroneous  unless  the  second  token  sequence  is
identical to the first, where all white space separations are taken to be equivalent.

A line of the form

    # define identifier (identifier-list) token-sequence




where  there  is  no  space  between  the  first  identifier  and  the  (,  is  a  macro  definition  with
parameters given by the identifier list. As with the first form, leading and trailing white space
arround  the  token  sequence  is  discarded,  and  the  macro  may  be  redefined  only  with  a
definition  in  which  the  number  and  spelling  of  parameters,  and  the  token  sequence,  is
identical.

208

A control line of the form

    # undef identifier

causes  the  identifier's  preprocessor  definition  to  be  forgotten.  It  is  not  erroneous  to  apply
#undef to an unknown identifier.

When a macro has been defined in the second form, subsequent textual instances of the macro
identifier followed by optional white space, and then by (, a sequence of tokens separated by
commas,  and  a  )  constitute  a  call  of  the  macro.  The  arguments  of  the  call  are  the  comma-
separated token sequences; commas that are quoted or protected by nested parentheses do not
separate  arguments.  During  collection,  arguments  are  not  macro-expanded.  The  number  of
arguments  in  the  call  must  match  the  number  of  parameters  in  the  definition.  After  the
arguments  are  isolated,  leading  and  trailing  white  space  is  removed  from  them.  Then  the
token sequence resulting from each argument is substituted for each unquoted occurrence of
the  corresponding  parameter's  identifier  in  the  replacement  token  sequence  of  the  macro.
Unless the parameter in the replacement sequence is preceded by #, or preceded or followed
by  ##,  the  argument  tokens  are  examined  for  macro  calls,  and  expanded  as  necessary,  just
before insertion.

Two  special  operators  influence  the  replacement  process.  First,  if  an  occurrence  of  a
parameter in the replacement token sequence is immediately preceded by #, string quotes (")
are  placed  around  the  corresponding  parameter,  and  then  both  the  #  and  the  parameter
identifier are replaced by the quoted argument. A  \ character is inserted before each  " or  \
character  that  appears  surrounding,  or  inside,  a  string  literal  or  character  constant  in  the
argument.

Second, if the definition token sequence for either kind of macro contains a ## operator, then
just after replacement of the parameters, each ## is deleted, together with any white space on
either  side,  so  as  to  concatenate  the  adjacent  tokens  and  form  a  new  token.  The  effect  is
undefined if invalid tokens are produced, or if the result depends on the order of processing of
the  ##  operators.  Also,  ##  may  not  appear  at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a  replacement  token
sequence.

In  both  kinds  of  macro,  the  replacement  token  sequence  is  repeatedly  rescanned  for  more
defined identifiers. However, once a given identifier has been replaced in a given expansion,
it is not replaced if it turns up again during rescanning; instead it is left unchanged.

Even  if  the  final  value  of  a  macro  expansion  begins  with  with  #,  it  is  not  taken  to  be  a
preprocessing directive.

The details of the macro-expansion process are described more precisely in the ANSI standard than in
the  first  edition.  The  most  important  change  is  the  addition  of  the  #  and  ##  operators,  which  make
quotation  and  concatenation  admissible.  Some  of  the  new  rules,  especially  those  involving
concatenation, are bizarre. (See example below.)



For example, this facility may be used for "manifest-constants," as in

209

   #define TABSIZE 100
   int table[TABSIZE];
The definition

   #define ABSDIFF(a, b)  ((a)>(b) ? (a)-(b) : (b)-(a))
defines a macro to return the absolute value of the difference between its arguments. Unlike a
function to do the same thing, the arguments and returned value may have any arithmetic type
or even be pointers. Also, the arguments, which might have side effects, are evaluated twice,
once for the test and once to produce the value.

Given the definition

   #define tempfile(dir)    #dir "%s"
the macro call tempfile(/usr/tmp) yields

   "/usr/tmp" "%s"
which will subsequently be catenated into a single string. After

   #define cat(x, y)       x ## y
the  call  cat(var,  123)  yields  var123.  However,  the  call  cat(cat(1,2),3)  is  undefined:
the  presence  of  ##  prevents  the  arguments  of  the  outer  call  from  being  expanded.  Thus  it
produces the token string

   cat  (  1  ,  2  )3
and )3 (the catenation of the last token of the first argument with the first token of the second)
is not a legal token. If a second level of macro definition is introduced,

   #define xcat(x, y)      cat(x,y)
things  work  more  smoothly;  xcat(xcat(1,  2),  3)  does  produce  123,  because  the
expansion of xcat itself does not involve the ## operator.

Likewise, ABSDIFF(ABSDIFF(a,b),c) produces the expected, fully-expanded result.

A.12.4 File Inclusion

A control line of the form

  # include <filename>

causes the replacement of that line by the entire contents of the file filename. The characters
in the name filename must not include > or newline, and the effect is undefined if it contains
any of ", ', \, or /*. The named file is searched for in a sequence of implementation-defined
places.

Similarly, a control line of the form

  # include "filename"










searches  first  in  association  with  the  original  source  file  (a  deliberately  implementation-
dependent phrase), and if that search fails, then as in the first form. The effect of using ', \, or
/* in the filename remains undefined, but > is permitted.

210

Finally, a directive of the form

  # include token-sequence

not matching one of the previous forms is interpreted by expanding the token sequence as for
normal  text;  one  of  the  two  forms  with  <...>  or  "..."  must  result,  and  is  then  treated  as
previously described.

#include files may be nested.

A.12.5 Conditional Compilation

Parts  of  a  program  may  be  compiled  conditionally,  according  to  the  following  schematic
syntax.

    preprocessor-conditional:
      if-line text elif-parts else-partopt #endif

    if-line:
      # if constant-expression
      # ifdef identifier
      # ifndef identifier

    elif-parts:
      elif-line text
      elif-partsopt

    elif-line:
      # elif constant-expression

    else-part:
      else-line text

    else-line:
      #else

Each  of  the  directives  (if-line,  elif-line,  else-line,  and  #endif)  appears  alone  on  a  line.  The
constant  expressions  in  #if  and  subsequent  #elif  lines  are  evaluated  in  order  until  an
expression with a non-zero value is found; text following a line with a zero value is discarded.
The text following the successful directive line is treated normally. "Text" here refers to any
material, including preprocessor lines, that is not part of the conditional structure; it may be
empty. Once a successful #if or #elif line has been found and its text processed, succeeding
#elif and #else lines, together with their text, are discarded. If all the expressions are zero,
and  there  is  an  #else,  the  text  following  the  #else  is  treated  normally.  Text  controlled  by
inactive arms of the conditional is ignored except for checking the nesting of conditionals.



The  constant  expression  in  #if  and  #elif  is  subject  to  ordinary  macro  replacement.
Moreover, any expressions of the form

211

    defined identifier

or

    defined (identifier)

are replaced, before scanning for macros, by 1L if the identifier is defined in the preprocessor,
and by 0L if not. Any identifiers remaining after macro expansion are replaced by 0L. Finally,
each integer constant is considered to be suffixed with L, so that all arithmetic is taken to be
long or unsigned long.

The resulting constant expression (Par.A.7.19) is restricted: it must be integral, and may not
contain sizeof, a cast, or an enumeration constant.

The control lines

    #ifdef identifier
    #ifndef identifier

are equivalent to

    # if defined identifier
    # if ! defined identifier

respectively.

#elif  is  new  since  the  first  edition,  although  it  has  been  available  is  some  preprocessors.  The
defined preprocessor operator is also new.

A.12.6 Line Control

For the benefit of other preprocessors that generate C programs, a line in one of the forms

    # line constant "filename"
    # line constant

causes the compiler to believe, for purposes of error diagnostics, that the line number of the
next source line is given by the decimal integer constant and the current input file is named by
the identifier. If the quoted filename is absent, the remembered name does not change. Macros
in the line are expanded before it is interpreted.

A.12.7 Error Generation

A preprocessor line of the form

    # error token-sequenceopt

causes the preprocessor to write a diagnostic message that includes the token sequence.



A.12.8 Pragmas

A control line of the form

    # pragma token-sequenceopt

causes  the  preprocessor  to  perform  an  implementation-dependent  action.  An  unrecognized
pragma is ignored.

212

A.12.9 Null directive

A control line of the form

    #

has no effect.

A.12.10 Predefined names

Several identifiers are predefined, and expand to produce special information. They, and also
the preprocessor expansion operator defined, may not be undefined or redefined.
__LINE__  A decimal constant containing the current source line number.
__FILE__  A string literal containing the name of the file being compiled.
__DATE__  A string literal containing the date of compilation, in the form "Mmmm dd yyyy"
__TIME__  A string literal containing the time of compilation, in the form "hh:mm:ss"
__STDC__  The constant 1. It is intended that this identifier be defined to be 1 only in standard-

conforming implementations.

#error and #pragma are new with the ANSI standard; the predefined preprocessor macros are new,
but some of them have been available in some implementations.

A.13 Grammar

Below  is  a  recapitulation  of  the  grammar  that  was  given  throughout  the  earlier  part  of  this
appendix. It has exactly the same content, but is in different order.

The grammar has undefined terminal symbols integer-constant, character-constant, floating-
constant,  identifier,  string,  and  enumeration-constant;  the  typewriter  style  words  and
symbols  are  terminals  given  literally.  This  grammar  can  be  transformed  mechanically  into
input  acceptable  for  an  automatic  parser-generator.  Besides  adding  whatever  syntactic
marking is used to indicate alternatives in productions, it is necessary to expand the "one of"
constructions,  and  (depending  on  the  rules  of  the  parser-generator)  to  duplicate  each
production  with  an  opt  symbol,  once  with  the  symbol  and  once  without.  With  one  further
change, namely deleting the production typedef-name: identifier and making typedef-name a
terminal symbol, this grammar is acceptable to the YACC parser-generator. It has only one
conflict, generated by the if-else ambiguity.
