subtitle: Functions and Program Structure
---

Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what
others have done instead of starting over from scratch. Appropriate functions hide details of
operation from parts of the program that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the
whole, and easing the pain of making changes.

C has been designed to make functions efficient and easy to use; C programs generally consist
of  many  small  functions  rather  than  a  few  big  ones.  A  program  may  reside  in  one  or  more
source  files.  Source  files  may  be  compiled  separately  and  loaded  together,  along  with
previously compiled functions from libraries. We will not go into that process here, however,
since the details vary from system to system.

Function declaration and definition is the area where the ANSI standard has made the most
changes to C. As we saw first in Chapter 1, it is now possible to declare the type of arguments
when  a  function  is  declared.  The  syntax  of  function  declaration  also  changes,  so  that
declarations and definitions match. This makes it possible for a compiler to detect many more
errors than it could before. Furthermore, when arguments are properly declared, appropriate
type coercions are performed automatically.

The standard clarifies the rules on the scope of names; in particular, it requires that there be
only  one  definition  of  each  external  object.  Initialization  is  more  general:  automatic  arrays
and structures may now be initialized.

The  C  preprocessor  has  also  been  enhanced.  New  preprocessor  facilities  include  a  more
complete set of conditional compilation directives, a way to create quoted strings from macro
arguments, and better control over the macro expansion process.

4.1 Basics of Functions

To begin with, let us design and write a program to print each line of its input that contains a
particular  "pattern"  or  string  of  characters.  (This  is  a  special  case  of  the  UNIX  program
grep.) For example, searching for the pattern of letters "ould" in the set of lines

   Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire
   To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
   Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
   Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
will produce the output

   Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire
   Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
   Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
The job falls neatly into three pieces:

while (there's another line)
    if (the line contains the pattern)
        print it







63

Although it's certainly possible to put the code for all of this in main, a better way is to use the
structure to advantage by making each part a separate function. Three small pieces are better
to deal with than one big one, because irrelevant details can be buried in the functions, and the
chance  of  unwanted  interactions  is  minimized.  And  the  pieces  may  even  be  useful  in  other
programs.

"While there's another line" is getline, a function that we wrote in Chapter 1, and "print it"
is  printf,  which  someone  has  already  provided  for  us.  This  means  we  need  only  write  a
routine to decide whether the line contains an occurrence of the pattern.

We can solve that problem by writing a function strindex(s,t) that returns the position or
index in the string s where the string t begins, or -1 if s does not contain t. Because C arrays
begin  at  position  zero,  indexes  will  be  zero  or  positive,  and  so  a  negative  value  like  -1  is
convenient for signaling failure. When we later need more sophisticated pattern matching, we
only  have  to  replace  strindex;  the  rest  of  the  code  can  remain  the  same.  (The  standard
library provides a function strstr that is similar to strindex, except that it returns a pointer
instead of an index.)

Given  this  much  design,  filling  in  the  details  of  the  program  is  straightforward.  Here  is  the
whole thing, so you can see how the pieces fit together. For now, the pattern to be searched
for is a literal string, which is not the most general of mechanisms. We will return shortly to a
discussion of how to initialize character arrays, and in Chapter 5 will show how to make the
pattern  a  parameter  that  is  set  when  the  program  is  run.  There  is  also  a  slightly  different
version of getline; you might find it instructive to compare it to the one in Chapter 1.

   #include <stdio.h>
   #define MAXLINE 1000 /* maximum input line length */

   int getline(char line[], int max)
   int strindex(char source[], char searchfor[]);

   char pattern[] = "ould";   /* pattern to search for */

   /* find all lines matching pattern */
   main()
   {
       char line[MAXLINE];
       int found = 0;

       while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
           if (strindex(line, pattern) >= 0) {
               printf("%s", line);
               found++;
           }
       return found;
   }

   /* getline:  get line into s, return length */
   int getline(char s[], int lim)
   {
       int c, i;

       i = 0;
       while (--lim > 0 && (c=getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n')
           s[i++] = c;
       if (c == '\n')
           s[i++] = c;










64

       s[i] = '\0';
       return i;
   }

   /* strindex:  return index of t in s, -1 if none */
   int strindex(char s[], char t[])
   {
       int i, j, k;

       for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
           for (j=i, k=0; t[k]!='\0' && s[j]==t[k]; j++, k++)
               ;
           if (k > 0 && t[k] == '\0')
               return i;
       }
       return -1;
   }
Each function definition has the form

return-type function-name(argument declarations)
{
    declarations and statements
}
Various parts may be absent; a minimal function is

   dummy() {}
which does nothing and returns nothing. A do-nothing function like this is sometimes useful
as a place holder during program development. If the return type is omitted, int is assumed.

A program is just a set of definitions of variables and functions. Communication between the
functions  is  by  arguments  and  values  returned  by  the  functions,  and  through  external
variables. The functions can occur in any order in the source file, and the source program can
be split into multiple files, so long as no function is split.

The return statement is the mechanism for returning a value from the called function to its
caller. Any expression can follow return:

   return expression;
The expression will be converted to the return type of the function if necessary. Parentheses
are often used around the expression, but they are optional.

The  calling  function  is  free  to  ignore  the  returned  value.  Furthermore,  there  need  to  be  no
expression after return; in that case, no value is returned to the caller. Control also returns to
the  caller  with  no  value  when  execution  "falls  off  the  end"  of  the  function  by  reaching  the
closing right brace. It is not illegal, but probably a sign of trouble, if a function returns a value
from one place and no value from another. In any case, if a function fails to return a value, its
"value" is certain to be garbage.

The pattern-searching program returns a status from main, the number of matches found. This
value is available for use by the environment that called the program

The mechanics of how to compile and load a C program that resides on multiple source files
vary  from  one  system  to  the  next.  On  the  UNIX  system,  for  example,  the  cc  command
mentioned in Chapter 1 does the job. Suppose that the three functions are stored in three files
called main.c, getline.c, and strindex.c. Then the command








65

   cc main.c getline.c strindex.c
compiles  the  three  files,  placing  the  resulting  object  code  in  files  main.o,  getline.o,  and
strindex.o, then loads them all into an executable file called a.out. If there is an error, say
in main.c, the file can be recompiled by itself and the result loaded with the previous object
files, with the command

   cc main.c getline.o strindex.o
The  cc  command  uses  the  ".c"  versus  ".o"  naming  convention  to  distinguish  source  files
from object files.

Exercise 4-1. Write the function strindex(s,t) which returns the position of the rightmost
occurrence of t in s, or -1 if there is none.

4.2 Functions Returning Non-integers

So far our examples of functions have returned either no value (void) or an  int. What if a
function  must  return  some  other  type?  many  numerical  functions  like  sqrt,  sin,  and  cos
return  double; other specialized functions return other types. To illustrate how to deal with
this,  let  us  write  and  use  the  function  atof(s),  which  converts  the  string  s  to  its  double-
precision floating-point equivalent. atof if an extension of atoi, which we showed versions
of  in  Chapters  2  and  3.  It  handles  an  optional  sign  and  decimal  point,  and  the  presence  or
absence  of  either  part  or  fractional  part.  Our  version  is  not  a  high-quality  input  conversion
routine;  that  would  take  more  space  than  we  care  to  use.  The  standard  library  includes  an
atof; the header <stdlib.h> declares it.

First, atof itself must declare the type of value it returns, since it is not int. The type name
precedes the function name:

   #include <ctype.h>

   /* atof:  convert string s to double */
   double atof(char s[])
   {
       double val, power;
       int i, sign;

       for (i = 0; isspace(s[i]); i++)  /* skip white space */
           ;
       sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
       if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-')
           i++;
       for (val = 0.0; isdigit(s[i]); i++)
           val = 10.0 * val + (s[i] - '0');
       if (s[i] == '.')
           i++;
       for (power = 1.0; isdigit(s[i]); i++) {
           val = 10.0 * val + (s[i] - '0');
           power *= 10;
       }
       return sign * val / power;
   }
Second, and just as important, the calling routine must know that atof returns a non-int value.
One way to ensure this is to declare atof explicitly in the calling routine. The declaration is
shown  in  this  primitive  calculator  (barely  adequate  for  check-book  balancing),  which  reads








one number per line, optionally preceded with a sign, and adds them up, printing the running
sum after each input:

66

   #include <stdio.h>

   #define MAXLINE 100

   /* rudimentary calculator */
   main()
   {
       double sum, atof(char []);
       char line[MAXLINE];
       int getline(char line[], int max);

       sum = 0;
       while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
           printf("\t%g\n", sum += atof(line));
       return 0;
   }
The declaration

   double sum, atof(char []);
says that sum is a double variable, and that atof is a function that takes one char[] argument
and returns a double.

The function atof must be declared and defined consistently. If atof itself and the call to it in
main  have  inconsistent  types  in  the  same  source  file,  the  error  will  be  detected  by  the
compiler. But if (as is more likely) atof were compiled separately, the mismatch would not
be detected,  atof would return a  double that  main would treat as an  int, and meaningless
answers would result.

In the light of what we have said about how declarations must match definitions, this might
seem surprising. The reason a mismatch can happen is that if there is no function prototype, a
function is implicitly declared by its first appearance in an expression, such as

   sum += atof(line)
If a name that has not been previously declared occurs in an expression and is followed by a
left parentheses, it is declared by context to be a function name, the function is assumed to
return  an  int,  and  nothing  is  assumed  about  its  arguments.  Furthermore,  if  a  function
declaration does not include arguments, as in

   double atof();
that  too  is  taken  to  mean  that  nothing  is  to  be  assumed  about  the  arguments  of  atof;  all
parameter checking is turned off. This special meaning of the empty argument list is intended
to permit older C programs to compile with new compilers. But it's a bad idea to use it with
new C programs. If the function takes arguments, declare them; if it takes no arguments, use
void.

Given atof, properly declared, we could write atoi (convert a string to int) in terms of it:

   /* atoi:  convert string s to integer using atof */
   int atoi(char s[])
   {
       double atof(char s[]);












67

       return (int) atof(s);
   }
Notice the structure of the declarations and the return statement. The value of the expression
in

   return expression;
is  converted  to  the  type  of  the  function  before  the  return  is  taken.  Therefore,  the  value  of
atof, a double, is converted automatically to int when it appears in this return, since the
function atoi returns an int. This operation does potentionally discard information, however,
so  some  compilers  warn  of  it.  The  cast  states  explicitly  that  the  operation  is  intended,  and
suppresses any warning.

Exercise 4-2. Extend atof to handle scientific notation of the form

   123.45e-6
where a floating-point number may be followed by e or E and an optionally signed exponent.

4.3 External Variables

A C program consists of a set of external objects, which are either variables or functions. The
adjective  "external"  is  used  in  contrast  to  "internal",  which  describes  the  arguments  and
variables defined inside functions. External variables are defined outside of any function, and
are thus potentionally available to many functions. Functions themselves are always external,
because C does not allow functions to be defined inside other functions. By default, external
variables and functions have the property that all references to them by the same name, even
from functions compiled separately, are references to the same thing. (The standard calls this
property  external  linkage.)  In  this  sense,  external  variables  are  analogous  to  Fortran
COMMON  blocks  or  variables  in  the  outermost  block  in  Pascal.  We  will  see  later  how  to
define  external  variables  and  functions  that  are  visible  only  within  a  single  source  file.
Because  external  variables  are  globally  accessible,  they  provide  an  alternative  to  function
arguments  and  return  values  for  communicating  data  between  functions.  Any  function  may
access  an  external  variable  by  referring  to  it  by  name,  if  the  name  has  been  declared
somehow.

If a large number of variables must be shared among functions, external variables are more
convenient and efficient than long argument lists. As pointed out in Chapter 1, however, this
reasoning  should  be  applied  with  some  caution,  for  it  can  have  a  bad  effect  on  program
structure, and lead to programs with too many data connections between functions.

External  variables  are  also  useful  because  of  their  greater  scope  and  lifetime.  Automatic
variables are internal to a function; they come into existence when the function is entered, and
disappear  when  it  is  left.  External  variables,  on  the  other  hand,  are  permanent,  so  they  can
retain values from one function invocation to the next. Thus if two functions must share some
data,  yet  neither  calls  the  other,  it  is  often  most  convenient  if  the  shared  data  is  kept  in
external variables rather than being passed in and out via arguments.

Let us examine this issue with a larger example. The problem is to write a calculator program
that provides the operators +, -, * and /. Because it is easier to implement, the calculator will
use reverse Polish notation instead of infix. (Reverse Polish notation is used by some pocket
calculators, and in languages like Forth and Postscript.)

In reverse Polish notation, each operator follows its operands; an infix expression like





68

   (1 - 2) * (4 + 5)
is entered as

   1 2 - 4 5 + *
Parentheses  are  not  needed;  the  notation  is  unambiguous  as  long  as  we  know  how  many
operands each operator expects.

The implementation is simple. Each operand is pushed onto a stack; when an operator arrives,
the proper number of operands (two for binary operators) is popped, the operator is applied to
them, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. In the example above, for instance, 1 and 2
are pushed, then replaced by their difference, -1. Next, 4 and 5 are pushed and then replaced
by their sum, 9. The product of -1 and 9, which is -9, replaces them on the stack. The value on
the top of the stack is popped and printed when the end of the input line is encountered.

The  structure  of  the  program  is  thus  a  loop  that  performs  the  proper  operation  on  each
operator and operand as it appears:

   while (next operator or operand is not end-of-file indicator)
       if (number)
           push it
       else if (operator)
           pop operands
           do operation
           push result
       else if (newline)
           pop and print top of stack
       else
           error
The operation of pushing and popping a stack are trivial, but by the time error detection and
recovery  are  added,  they  are  long  enough  that  it is better to put each in a separate function
than  to  repeat  the  code  throughout  the  whole  program.  And  there  should  be  a  separate
function for fetching the next input operator or operand.

The main design decision that has not yet been discussed is where the stack is, that is, which
routines  access  it  directly.  On  possibility  is  to  keep  it  in  main,  and  pass  the  stack  and  the
current  stack  position  to  the  routines  that  push  and  pop  it.  But  main  doesn't  need  to  know
about the variables that control the stack; it only does push and pop operations. So we have
decided to store the stack and its associated information in external variables accessible to the
push and pop functions but not to main.

Translating  this  outline  into  code  is  easy  enough.  If  for  now  we  think  of  the  program  as
existing in one source file, it will look like this:

    #includes
    #defines

    function declarations for main

    main() { ... }

    external variables for push and pop







69

   void push( double f) { ... }
   double pop(void) { ... }

   int getop(char s[]) { ... }
    routines called by getop

Later we will discuss how this might be split into two or more source files.

The function main is a loop containing a big switch on the type of operator or operand; this is
a more typical use of switch than the one shown in Section 3.4.

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>  /* for  atof() */

   #define MAXOP   100  /* max size of operand or operator */
   #define NUMBER  '0'  /* signal that a number was found */

   int getop(char []);
   void push(double);
   double pop(void);

   /* reverse Polish calculator */
   main()
   {
       int type;
       double op2;
       char s[MAXOP];

       while ((type = getop(s)) != EOF) {
           switch (type) {
           case NUMBER:
               push(atof(s));
               break;
           case '+':
               push(pop() + pop());
               break;
           case '*':
               push(pop() * pop());
               break;
           case '-':
               op2 = pop();
               push(pop() - op2);
               break;
           case '/':
               op2 = pop();
               if (op2 != 0.0)
                   push(pop() / op2);
               else
                   printf("error: zero divisor\n");
               break;
           case '\n':
               printf("\t%.8g\n", pop());
               break;
           default:
               printf("error: unknown command %s\n", s);
               break;
           }
       }
       return 0;
   }









Because  +  and  *  are  commutative  operators,  the  order  in  which  the  popped  operands  are
combined is irrelevant, but for - and / the left and right operand must be distinguished. In

   push(pop() - pop());   /* WRONG */
the order in which the two calls of  pop are evaluated is not defined. To guarantee the right
order, it is necessary to pop the first value into a temporary variable as we did in main.

70

   #define MAXVAL  100  /* maximum depth of val stack */

   int sp = 0;          /* next free stack position */
   double val[MAXVAL];  /* value stack */

   /* push:  push f onto value stack */
   void push(double f)
   {
       if (sp < MAXVAL)
           val[sp++] = f;
       else
           printf("error: stack full, can't push %g\n", f);
   }

   /* pop:  pop and return top value from stack */
   double pop(void)
   {
       if (sp > 0)
           return val[--sp];
       else {
           printf("error: stack empty\n");
           return 0.0;
       }
   }
A variable is external if it is defined outside of any function. Thus the stack and stack index
that must be shared by push and pop are defined outside these functions. But main itself does
not refer to the stack or stack position - the representation can be hidden.

Let us now turn to the implementation of getop, the function that fetches the next operator or
operand.  The  task  is  easy.  Skip  blanks  and  tabs.  If  the  next  character  is  not  a  digit  or  a
hexadecimal  point,  return  it.  Otherwise,  collect  a  string  of  digits  (which  might  include  a
decimal point), and return NUMBER, the signal that a number has been collected.

   #include <ctype.h>

   int getch(void);
   void ungetch(int);

   /* getop:  get next character or numeric operand */
   int getop(char s[])
   {
       int i, c;

       while ((s[0] = c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\t')
           ;
       s[1] = '\0';
       if (!isdigit(c) && c != '.')
           return c;      /* not a number */
       i = 0;
       if (isdigit(c))    /* collect integer part */
           while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))
              ;
       if (c == '.')      /* collect fraction part */












71

           while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))
              ;
       s[i] = '\0';
       if (c != EOF)
           ungetch(c);
       return NUMBER;
   }
What are getch and ungetch? It is often the case that a program cannot determine that it has
read enough input until it has read too much. One instance is collecting characters that make
up  a  number:  until  the  first  non-digit  is  seen,  the  number  is  not  complete.  But  then  the
program has read one character too far, a character that it is not prepared for.

The problem would be solved if it were possible to "un-read" the unwanted character. Then,
every time the program reads one character too many, it could push it back on the input, so
the rest of the code could behave as if it had never been read. Fortunately, it's easy to simulate
un-getting  a  character,  by  writing  a  pair  of  cooperating  functions.  getch  delivers  the  next
input character to be considered; ungetch will return them before reading new input.

How  they  work  together  is  simple.  ungetch  puts  the  pushed-back  characters  into  a  shared
buffer  --  a  character  array.  getch  reads  from  the  buffer  if  there  is  anything  else,  and  calls
getchar if the buffer is empty. There must also be an index variable that records the position
of the current character in the buffer.

Since the buffer and the index are shared by getch and ungetch and must retain their values
between calls, they must be external to both routines. Thus we can write getch, ungetch, and
their shared variables as:

   #define BUFSIZE 100

   char buf[BUFSIZE];    /* buffer for ungetch */
   int bufp = 0;         /* next free position in buf */

   int getch(void)  /* get a (possibly pushed-back) character */
   {
       return (bufp > 0) ? buf[--bufp] : getchar();
   }

   void ungetch(int c)   /* push character back on input */
   {
       if (bufp >= BUFSIZE)
           printf("ungetch: too many characters\n");
       else
           buf[bufp++] = c;
   }
The standard library includes a function ungetch that provides one character of pushback; we
will  discuss  it  in  Chapter  7.  We  have  used  an  array  for  the  pushback,  rather  than  a  single
character, to illustrate a more general approach.

Exercise  4-3.  Given  the  basic  framework,  it's  straightforward  to  extend  the  calculator.  Add
the modulus (%) operator and provisions for negative numbers.

Exercise 4-4. Add the commands to print the top elements of the stack without popping, to
duplicate it, and to swap the top two elements. Add a command to clear the stack.







72

Exercise  4-5.  Add  access  to  library  functions  like  sin,  exp,  and  pow.  See  <math.h>  in
Appendix B, Section 4.

Exercise 4-6. Add commands for handling variables. (It's easy to provide twenty-six variables
with single-letter names.) Add a variable for the most recently printed value.

Exercise 4-7. Write a routine ungets(s) that will push back an entire string onto the input.
Should ungets know about buf and bufp, or should it just use ungetch?

Exercise 4-8. Suppose that there will never be more than one character of pushback. Modify
getch and ungetch accordingly.

Exercise  4-9.  Our  getch  and  ungetch  do  not  handle  a  pushed-back  EOF  correctly.  Decide
what their properties ought to be if an EOF is pushed back, then implement your design.

Exercise 4-10. An alternate organization uses getline to read an entire input line; this makes
getch and ungetch unnecessary. Revise the calculator to use this approach.

4.4 Scope Rules

The functions and external variables that make up a C program need not all be compiled at the
same  time;  the  source  text  of  the  program  may  be  kept  in  several  files,  and  previously
compiled routines may be loaded from libraries. Among the questions of interest are

•  How  are  declarations  written  so  that  variables  are  properly  declared  during

compilation?

•  How are declarations arranged so that all the pieces will be properly connected when

the program is loaded?

•  How are declarations organized so there is only one copy?
•  How are external variables initialized?

Let  us  discuss  these  topics  by  reorganizing  the  calculator  program  into  several  files.  As  a
practical matter, the calculator is too small to be worth splitting, but it is a fine illustration of
the issues that arise in larger programs.

The scope of a name is the part of the program within which the name can be used. For an
automatic variable declared at the beginning of a function, the scope is the function in which
the name is declared. Local variables of the same name in different functions are unrelated.
The same is true of the parameters of the function, which are in effect local variables.

The scope of an external variable or a function lasts from the point at which it is declared to
the end of the file being compiled. For example, if main, sp, val, push, and pop are defined
in one file, in the order shown above, that is,

   main() { ... }

   int sp = 0;
   double val[MAXVAL];

   void push(double f) { ... }

   double pop(void) { ... }







73

then  the  variables  sp  and  val  may  be  used  in  push  and  pop  simply  by  naming  them;  no
further declarations are needed. But these names are not visible in main, nor are push and pop
themselves.

On  the  other  hand,  if  an  external  variable  is  to be referred to before it is defined, or if it is
defined  in  a  different  source  file  from  the  one  where  it  is  being  used,  then  an  extern
declaration is mandatory.

It is important to distinguish between the declaration of an external variable and its definition.
A  declaration  announces  the  properties  of  a  variable  (primarily  its  type);  a  definition  also
causes storage to be set aside. If the lines

   int sp;
   double val[MAXVAL];
appear outside of any function, they define the external variables sp and val, cause storage to
be  set  aside,  and  also  serve  as  the  declarations  for  the  rest  of  that  source  file.  On  the  other
hand, the lines

   extern int sp;
   extern double val[];
declare for the rest of the source file that sp is an int and that val is a double array (whose
size is determined elsewhere), but they do not create the variables or reserve storage for them.

There must be only one definition of an external variable among all the files that make up the
source program; other files may contain extern declarations to access it. (There may also be
extern declarations in the file containing the definition.) Array sizes must be specified with
the definition, but are optional with an extern declaration.

Initialization of an external variable goes only with the definition.

Although it is not a likely organization for this program, the functions push and pop could be
defined in one file, and the variables val and sp defined and initialized in another. Then these
definitions and declarations would be necessary to tie them together:

  in file1:

      extern int sp;
      extern double val[];

      void push(double f) { ... }

      double pop(void) { ... }
  in file2:

      int sp = 0;
      double val[MAXVAL];
Because the extern declarations in file1 lie ahead of and outside the function definitions, they
apply to all functions; one set of declarations suffices for all of file1. This same organization
would also bee needed if the definition of sp and val followed their use in one file.

4.5 Header Files









74

Let is now consider dividing the calculator program into several source files, as it might be is
each  of  the  components  were  substantially  bigger.  The  main  function  would  go  in  one  file,
which  we  will  call  main.c;  push,  pop,  and  their  variables  go  into  a  second  file,  stack.c;
getop goes into a third, getop.c. Finally, getch and ungetch go into a fourth file, getch.c;
we  separate  them  from  the  others  because  they  would  come  from  a  separately-compiled
library in a realistic program.

There is one more thing to worry about - the definitions and declarations shared among files.
As much as possible, we want to centralize this, so that there is only one copy to get and keep
right as the program evolves. Accordingly, we will place this common material in a header
file, calc.h, which will be included as necessary. (The #include line is described in Section
4.11.) The resulting program then looks like this:

There  is  a  tradeoff  between  the  desire  that  each  file  have  access  only  to  the  information  it
needs for its job and the practical reality that it is harder to maintain more header files. Up to
some  moderate  program  size,  it  is  probably  best  to  have  one  header  file  that  contains




everything that is to be shared between any two parts of the program; that is the decision we
made here. For a much larger program, more organization and more headers would be needed.

75

4.6 Static Variables

The variables sp and val in stack.c, and buf and bufp in getch.c, are for the private use of
the  functions  in  their  respective  source  files,  and  are  not  meant  to  be  accessed  by  anything
else. The static declaration, applied to an external variable or function, limits the scope of
that object to the rest of the source file being compiled. External static thus provides a way
to hide names like buf and bufp in the getch-ungetch combination, which must be external
so they can be shared, yet which should not be visible to users of getch and ungetch.

Static  storage  is  specified  by  prefixing  the  normal  declaration  with  the  word  static. If the
two routines and the two variables are compiled in one file, as in

   static char buf[BUFSIZE];  /* buffer for ungetch */
   static int bufp = 0;       /* next free position in buf */

   int getch(void) { ... }

   void ungetch(int c) { ... }
then no other routine will be able to access buf and bufp, and those names will not conflict
with the same names in other files of the same program. In the same way, the variables that
push  and  pop  use  for  stack  manipulation  can  be  hidden,  by  declaring  sp  and  val  to  be
static.

The  external  static  declaration  is  most  often  used  for  variables,  but  it  can  be  applied  to
functions  as  well.  Normally,  function  names  are  global,  visible  to  any  part  of  the  entire
program. If a function is declared static, however, its name is invisible outside of the file in
which it is declared.

The static declaration can also be applied to internal variables. Internal static variables are
local  to  a  particular  function  just  as  automatic  variables  are,  but  unlike  automatics,  they
remain  in  existence  rather  than  coming  and  going  each  time  the  function  is  activated.  This
means  that  internal  static  variables  provide  private,  permanent  storage  within  a  single
function.

Exercise  4-11.  Modify  getop  so  that  it  doesn't  need  to  use  ungetch.  Hint:  use  an  internal
static variable.

4.7 Register Variables

A  register  declaration  advises  the  compiler  that  the  variable  in  question  will  be  heavily
used. The idea is that  register variables are to be placed in machine registers, which may
result in smaller and faster programs. But compilers are free to ignore the advice.

The register declaration looks like

   register int  x;
   register char c;







76

and  so  on.  The  register  declaration  can  only  be  applied  to  automatic  variables  and  to  the
formal parameters of a function. In this later case, it looks like

   f(register unsigned m, register long n)
   {
       register int i;
       ...
   }
In  practice,  there  are  restrictions  on  register  variables,  reflecting  the  realities  of  underlying
hardware.  Only  a  few  variables  in  each  function  may  be  kept  in  registers,  and  only  certain
types  are  allowed.  Excess  register  declarations  are  harmless,  however,  since  the  word
register is ignored for excess or disallowed declarations. And it is not possible to take the
address of a register variable (a topic covered in Chapter 5), regardless of whether the variable
is  actually  placed  in  a  register.  The  specific  restrictions  on  number  and  types  of  register
variables vary from machine to machine.

4.8 Block Structure

C  is  not  a  block-structured  language  in  the  sense  of  Pascal  or  similar  languages,  because
functions  may  not  be  defined  within  other  functions.  On  the  other  hand,  variables  can  be
defined in a block-structured fashion within a function. Declarations of variables (including
initializations) may follow the left brace that introduces any compound statement, not just the
one  that  begins  a  function.  Variables  declared  in  this  way  hide  any  identically  named
variables in outer blocks, and remain in existence until the matching right brace. For example,
in

   if (n > 0) {
       int i;  /* declare a new i */

       for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
           ...
   }
the scope of the variable i is the "true" branch of the if; this i is unrelated to any i outside
the block. An automatic variable declared and initialized in a block is initialized each time the
block is entered.

Automatic variables, including formal parameters, also hide external variables and functions
of the same name. Given the declarations

   int x;
   int y;

   f(double x)
   {
       double y;
   }
then within the function f, occurrences of x refer to the parameter, which is a double; outside
f, they refer to the external int. The same is true of the variable y.

As a matter of style, it's best to avoid variable names that conceal names in an outer scope; the
potential for confusion and error is too great.

4.9 Initialization








77

Initialization  has  been  mentioned  in  passing  many  times  so  far,  but  always  peripherally  to
some other topic. This section summarizes some of the rules, now that we have discussed the
various storage classes.

In  the  absence  of  explicit  initialization,  external  and  static  variables  are  guaranteed  to  be
initialized  to  zero;  automatic  and  register  variables  have  undefined  (i.e.,  garbage)  initial
values.

Scalar  variables  may  be  initialized  when  they  are  defined,  by  following  the  name  with  an
equals sign and an expression:

   int x = 1;
   char squota = '\";
   long day = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L; /* milliseconds/day */
For  external  and  static  variables,  the  initializer  must  be  a  constant  expression;  the
initialization is done once, conceptionally before the program begins execution. For automatic
and  register  variables,  the  initializer  is  not  restricted  to  being  a  constant:  it  may  be  any
expression  involving  previously  defined  values,  even  function  calls.  For  example,  the
initialization of the binary search program in Section 3.3 could be written as

   int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)
   {
       int low = 0;
       int high = n - 1;
       int mid;
       ...
   }
instead of

       int low, high, mid;

       low = 0;
       high = n - 1;
In  effect,  initialization  of  automatic  variables  are  just  shorthand  for  assignment  statements.
Which  form  to  prefer  is  largely  a  matter  of  taste.  We  have  generally  used  explicit
assignments, because initializers in declarations are harder to see and further away from the
point of use.

An array may be initialized by following its declaration with a list of initializers enclosed in
braces and separated by commas. For example, to initialize an array days with the number of
days in each month:

   int days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 }
When the size of the array is omitted, the compiler will compute the length by counting the
initializers, of which there are 12 in this case.

If there are fewer initializers for an array than the specified size, the others will be zero for
external, static and automatic variables. It is an error to have too many initializers. There is no
way to specify repetition of an initializer, nor to initialize an element in the middle of an array
without supplying all the preceding values as well.

Character arrays are a special case of initialization; a string may be used instead of the braces
and commas notation:








78

   char pattern = "ould";
is a shorthand for the longer but equivalent

   char pattern[] = { 'o', 'u', 'l', 'd', '\0' };
In this case, the array size is five (four characters plus the terminating '\0').

4.10 Recursion

C  functions  may  be  used  recursively;  that  is,  a  function  may  call  itself  either  directly  or
indirectly.  Consider  printing  a  number  as  a  character  string.  As  we  mentioned  before,  the
digits are generated in the wrong order: low-order digits are available before high-order digits,
but they have to be printed the other way around.

There  are  two  solutions  to  this  problem.  On  is  to  store  the  digits  in  an  array  as  they  are
generated,  then  print  them  in  the  reverse  order,  as  we  did  with  itoa  in  section  3.6.  The
alternative is a recursive solution, in which printd first calls itself to cope with any leading
digits,  then  prints  the  trailing  digit.  Again,  this  version  can  fail  on  the  largest  negative
number.

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* printd:  print n in decimal */
   void printd(int n)
   {
       if (n < 0) {
           putchar('-');
           n = -n;
       }
       if (n / 10)
           printd(n / 10);
       putchar(n % 10 + '0');
   }
When a function calls itself recursively, each invocation gets a fresh set of all the automatic
variables, independent of the previous set. This in printd(123) the first printd receives the
argument  n  =  123. It passes  12 to a second  printd, which in turn passes  1 to a third. The
third-level printd prints 1, then returns to the second level. That printd prints 2, then returns
to the first level. That one prints 3 and terminates.

Another  good  example  of  recursion  is  quicksort,  a  sorting  algorithm  developed  by  C.A.R.
Hoare  in  1962.  Given  an  array,  one  element  is  chosen  and  the  others  partitioned  in  two
subsets - those less than the partition element and those greater than or equal to it. The same
process  is  then  applied  recursively  to  the  two  subsets.  When  a  subset  has  fewer  than  two
elements, it doesn't need any sorting; this stops the recursion.

Our  version  of  quicksort  is  not  the  fastest  possible,  but  it's  one  of  the  simplest.  We  use  the
middle element of each subarray for partitioning.

   /* qsort:  sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */
   void qsort(int v[], int left, int right)
   {
       int i, last;
       void swap(int v[], int i, int j);









79

       if (left >= right) /* do nothing if array contains */
           return;        /* fewer than two elements */
       swap(v, left, (left + right)/2); /* move partition elem */
       last = left;                     /* to v[0] */
       for (i = left + 1; i <= right; i++)  /* partition */
           if (v[i] < v[left])
               swap(v, ++last, i);
       swap(v, left, last);            /* restore partition  elem */
       qsort(v, left, last-1);
       qsort(v, last+1, right);
   }
We moved the swapping operation into a separate function swap because it occurs three times
in qsort.

   /* swap:  interchange v[i] and v[j] */
   void swap(int v[], int i, int j)
   {
       int temp;

       temp = v[i];
       v[i] = v[j];
       v[j] = temp;
   }
The standard library includes a version of qsort that can sort objects of any type.

Recursion  may  provide  no  saving  in  storage,  since  somewhere  a  stack  of  the  values  being
processed must be maintained. Nor will it be faster. But recursive code is more compact, and
often  much  easier  to  write  and  understand  than  the  non-recursive  equivalent.  Recursion  is
especially  convenient  for  recursively  defined  data  structures  like  trees,  we  will  see  a  nice
example in Section 6.6.

Exercise 4-12. Adapt the ideas of printd to write a recursive version of itoa; that is, convert
an integer into a string by calling a recursive routine.

Exercise  4-13.  Write  a  recursive  version  of  the  function  reverse(s),  which  reverses  the
string s in place.

4.11 The C Preprocessor

C provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which is conceptionally a
separate  first  step  in  compilation.  The  two  most  frequently  used  features  are  #include,  to
include  the  contents  of  a  file  during  compilation,  and  #define,  to  replace  a  token  by  an
arbitrary sequence of characters. Other features described in this section include conditional
compilation and macros with arguments.

4.11.1 File Inclusion

File inclusion makes it easy to handle collections of #defines and declarations (among other
things). Any source line of the form

   #include "filename"
or

   #include <filename>
is replaced by the contents of the file filename. If the filename is quoted, searching for the file
typically begins where the source program was found; if it is not found there, or if the name is







80

enclosed  in  <  and  >,  searching  follows  an  implementation-defined  rule  to  find  the  file.  An
included file may itself contain #include lines.

There are often several #include lines at the beginning of a source file, to include common
#define statements and extern declarations, or to access the function prototype declarations
for library functions from headers like <stdio.h>. (Strictly speaking, these need not be files;
the details of how headers are accessed are implementation-dependent.)

#include  is  the  preferred  way  to  tie  the  declarations  together  for  a  large  program.  It
guarantees  that  all  the  source  files  will  be  supplied  with  the  same  definitions  and  variable
declarations, and thus eliminates a particularly nasty kind of bug. Naturally, when an included
file is changed, all files that depend on it must be recompiled.

4.11.2 Macro Substitution

A definition has the form

   #define name replacement text
It  calls  for  a  macro  substitution  of  the  simplest  kind  -  subsequent  occurrences  of  the  token
name will be replaced by the replacement text. The name in a #define has the same form as a
variable name; the replacement text is arbitrary. Normally the replacement text is the rest of
the line, but a long definition may be continued onto several lines by placing a \ at the end of
each  line  to  be  continued.  The  scope  of  a  name  defined  with  #define  is  from  its  point  of
definition  to  the  end  of  the  source  file  being  compiled.  A  definition  may  use  previous
definitions.  Substitutions  are  made  only  for  tokens,  and  do  not  take  place  within  quoted
strings.  For  example,  if  YES  is  a  defined  name,  there  would  be  no  substitution  in
printf("YES") or in YESMAN.

Any name may be defined with any replacement text. For example

   #define  forever  for (;;)    /* infinite loop */
defines a new word, forever, for an infinite loop.

It is also possible to define macros with arguments, so the replacement text can be different
for different calls of the macro. As an example, define a macro called max:

   #define  max(A, B)  ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
Although it looks like a function call, a use of max expands into in-line code. Each occurrence
of  a  formal  parameter  (here  A  or  B)  will  be  replaced  by  the  corresponding  actual  argument.
Thus the line

   x = max(p+q, r+s);
will be replaced by the line

   x = ((p+q) > (r+s) ? (p+q) : (r+s));
So  long  as  the  arguments  are  treated  consistently,  this  macro  will  serve  for  any  data  type;
there  is  no  need  for  different  kinds  of  max  for  different  data  types,  as  there  would  be  with
functions.








If  you  examine  the  expansion  of  max,  you  will  notice  some  pitfalls.  The  expressions  are
evaluated twice; this is bad if they involve side effects like increment operators or input and
output. For instance

81

   max(i++, j++)  /* WRONG */
will increment the larger twice. Some care also has to be taken with parentheses to make sure
the order of evaluation is preserved; consider what happens when the macro

   #define square(x)  x * x  /* WRONG */
is invoked as square(z+1).

Nonetheless,  macros  are  valuable.  One  practical  example  comes  from  <stdio.h>,  in  which
getchar  and  putchar  are  often  defined  as  macros  to  avoid  the  run-time  overhead  of  a
function  call  per  character  processed.  The  functions  in  <ctype.h>  are  also  usually
implemented as macros.

Names may be undefined with #undef, usually to ensure that a routine is really a function, not
a macro:

   #undef getchar

   int getchar(void) { ... }
Formal parameters are not replaced within quoted strings. If, however, a parameter name is
preceded by a # in the replacement text, the combination will be expanded into a quoted string
with  the  parameter  replaced  by  the  actual  argument.  This  can  be  combined  with  string
concatenation to make, for example, a debugging print macro:

   #define  dprint(expr)   printf(#expr " = %g\n", expr)
When this is invoked, as in

   dprint(x/y)
the macro is expanded into

   printf("x/y" " = &g\n", x/y);
and the strings are concatenated, so the effect is

   printf("x/y = &g\n", x/y);
Within the actual argument, each " is replaced by \" and each \ by \\, so the result is a legal
string constant.

The preprocessor operator  ## provides a way to concatenate actual arguments during macro
expansion. If a parameter in the replacement text is adjacent to a ##, the parameter is replaced
by the actual argument, the ## and surrounding white space are removed, and the result is re-
scanned. For example, the macro paste concatenates its two arguments:

   #define  paste(front, back)  front ## back
so paste(name, 1) creates the token name1.

The rules for nested uses of ## are arcane; further details may be found in Appendix A.

Exercise  4-14.  Define  a  macro  swap(t,x,y)  that  interchanges  two  arguments  of  type  t.
(Block structure will help.)












82

4.11.3 Conditional Inclusion

It  is  possible  to  control  preprocessing  itself  with  conditional  statements  that  are  evaluated
during preprocessing. This provides a way to include code selectively, depending on the value
of conditions evaluated during compilation.

The #if line evaluates a constant integer expression (which may not include sizeof, casts, or
enum constants). If the expression is non-zero, subsequent lines until an #endif or #elif or
#else  are  included.  (The  preprocessor  statement  #elif  is  like  else-if.)  The  expression
defined(name) in a #if is 1 if the name has been defined, and 0 otherwise.

For  example,  to  make  sure  that  the  contents  of  a  file  hdr.h  are  included  only  once,  the
contents of the file are surrounded with a conditional like this:

   #if !defined(HDR)
   #define HDR

   /* contents of hdr.h go here */

   #endif
The first inclusion of hdr.h defines the name HDR; subsequent inclusions will find the name
defined  and  skip  down  to  the  #endif.  A  similar  style  can  be  used  to  avoid  including  files
multiple times. If this style is used consistently, then each header can itself include any other
headers  on  which  it  depends,  without  the  user  of  the  header  having  to  deal  with  the
interdependence.

This sequence tests the name SYSTEM to decide which version of a header to include:

   #if SYSTEM == SYSV
       #define HDR "sysv.h"
   #elif SYSTEM == BSD
       #define HDR "bsd.h"
   #elif SYSTEM == MSDOS
       #define HDR "msdos.h"
   #else
       #define HDR "default.h"
   #endif
   #include HDR
The #ifdef and #ifndef lines are specialized forms that test whether a name is defined. The
first example of #if above could have been written

   #ifndef HDR
   #define HDR

   /* contents of hdr.h go here */

   #endif
