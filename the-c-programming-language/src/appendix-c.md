title: Appendix C
subtitle: Summary of Changes
---

Since  the  publication  of  the  first  edition  of  this  book,  the  definition  of  the  C  language  has
undergone changes. Almost all were extensions of the original language, and were carefully
designed  to  remain  compatible  with  existing  practice;  some  repaired  ambiguities  in  the
original description; and some represent modifications that change existing practice. Many of
the new facilities were announced in the documents accompanying compilers available from
AT&T,  and  have  subsequently  been  adopted  by  other  suppliers  of  C  compilers.  More
recently, the ANSI committee standardizing the language incorporated most of the changes,
and  also  introduced  other  significant  modifications. Their report was in part participated by
some commercial compilers even before issuance of the formal C standard.

This Appendix summarizes the differences between the language defined by the first edition
of this book, and that expected to be defined by the final standard. It treats only the language
itself,  not  its  environment  and  library;  although  these  are  an  important  part  of  the  standard,
there  is  little  to  compare  with,  because  the  first  edition  did  not  attempt  to  prescribe  an
environment or library.

•  Preprocessing is more carefully defined in the Standard than in the first edition, and is
extended:  it  is  explicitly  token  based;  there  are  new  operators  for  concatenation  of
tokens  (##),  and  creation  of  strings  (#);  there  are  new  control  lines  like  #elif  and
#pragma; redeclaration of macros by the same token sequence is explicitly permitted;
parameters  inside  strings  are  no  longer  replaced.  Splicing  of  lines  by  \  is  permitted
everywhere, not just in strings and macro definitions. See Par.A.12.

•  The  minimum  significance  of  all  internal  identifiers  increased  to  31  characters;  the
smallest  mandated  significance  of  identifiers  with  external  linkage  remains  6
monocase letters. (Many implementations provide more.)

•  Trigraph  sequences  introduced  by  ??  allow  representation  of  characters  lacking  in
some character sets. Escapes for #\^[]{}|~ are defined, see Par.A.12.1. Observe that
the  introduction  of  trigraphs  may  change  the  meaning  of  strings  containing  the
sequence ??.

•  New  keywords  (void,  const,  volatile,  signed,  enum)  are  introduced.  The

stillborn entry keyword is withdrawn.

•  New  escape  sequences,  for  use  within  character  constants  and  string  literals,  are
defined.  The  effect  of  following  \  by  a  character  not  part  of  an  approved  escape
sequence is undefined. See Par.A.2.5.2.

•  Everyone's favorite trivial change: 8 and 9 are not octal digits.
•  The standard introduces a larger set of suffixes to make the type of constants explicit:
U or L for integers, F or L for floating. It also refines the rules for the type of unsiffixed
constants (Par.A.2.5).

•  Adjacent string literals are concatenated.
•  There  is  a  notation  for  wide-character  string  literals  and  character  constants;  see

Par.A.2.6.

•  Characters as well as other types, may be explicitly declared to carry, or not to carry, a
sign  by  using  the  keywords  signed  or  unsigned.  The  locution  long  float  as  a
synonym for double is withdrawn, but long double may be used to declare an extra-
precision floating quantity.

•  For some time, type unsigned char has been available. The standard introduces the
signed keyword to make signedness explicit for char and other integral objects.

•  The  void  type  has  been  available  in  most  implementations  for  some  years.  The
Standard introduces the use of the void  * type as a generic pointer type; previously
char  * played this role. At the same time, explicit rules are enacted against mixing
pointers and integers, and pointers of different type, without the use of casts.

•  The  Standard  places  explicit  minima  on  the  ranges  of  the  arithmetic  types,  and
mandates  headers  (<limits.h>  and  <float.h>)  giving  the  characteristics  of  each
particular implementation.

•  Enumerations are new since the first edition of this book.
•  The  Standard  adopts  from  C++  the  notion  of  type  qualifier,  for  example  const

(Par.A.8.2).

•  Strings are no longer modifiable, and so may be placed in read-only memory.
•  The  "usual  arithmetic  conversions"  are  changed,  essentially  from  "for  integers,
unsigned  always  wins;  for  floating  point,  always  use  double"  to  "promote  to  the
smallest capacious-enough type." See Par.A.6.5.

•  The  old  assignment  operators  like  =+  are  truly  gone.  Also,  assignment  operators  are
now  single  tokens;  in  the  first  edition,  they  were  pairs,  and  could  be  separated  by
white space.

•  A compiler's license to treat mathematically associative operators as computationally

associative is revoked.

•  A unary + operator is introduced for symmetry with unary -.
•  A  pointer  to  a  function  may  be  used  as  a  function  designator  without  an  explicit  *

operator. See Par.A.7.3.2.

•  Structures may be assigned, passed to functions, and returned by functions.
•  Applying the address-of operator to arrays is permitted, and the result is a pointer to

the array.

•  The  sizeof  operator,  in  the  first  edition,  yielded  type  int;  subsequently,  many
implementations  made  it  unsigned.  The  Standard  makes  its  type  explicitly
implementation-dependent, but requires the type, size_t, to be defined in a standard
header  (<stddef.h>).  A  similar  change  occurs  in  the  type  (ptrdiff_t)  of  the
difference between pointers. See Par.A.7.4.8 and Par.A.7.7.
The address-of operator & may not be applied to an object declared register, even if
the implementation chooses not to keep the object in a register.
The  type  of  a  shift  expression  is  that  of  the  left  operand;  the  right  operand  can't
promote the result. See Par.A.7.8.

•  The Standard legalizes the creation of a pointer just beyond the end of an array, and

allows arithmetic and relations on it; see Par.A.7.7.

•  The  Standard  introduces  (borrowing  from  C++)  the  notion  of  a  function  prototype
declaration  that  incorporates  the  types  of  the  parameters,  and  includes  an  explicit
recognition of variadic functions together with an approved way of dealing with them.
See Pars. A.7.3.2, A.8.6.3, B.7. The older style is still accepted, with restrictions.
•  Empty  declarations,  which  have  no  declarators  and  don't  declare  at  least  a  structure,
union, or enumeration, are forbidden by the Standard. On the other hand, a declaration
with just a structure or union tag redeclares that tag even if it was declared in an outer
scope.

•  External data declarations without any specifiers or qualifiers (just a naked declarator)

are forbidden.

•  Some implementations, when presented with an extern declaration in an inner block,
would export the declaration to the rest of the file. The Standard makes it clear that the
scope of such a declaration is just the block.

•  The  scope  of  parameters  is  injected  into  a  function's  compound  statement,  so  that

variable declarations at the top level of the function cannot hide the parameters.

•  The name spaces of identifiers are somewhat different. The Standard puts all tags in a
single  name  space,  and  also  introduces  a  separate  name  space  for  labels;  see
Par.A.11.1. Also, member names are associated with the structure or union of which
they are a part. (This has been common practice from some time.)
•  Unions may be initialized; the initializer refers to the first member.
•  Automatic structures, unions, and arrays may be initialized, albeit in a restricted way.
•  Character arrays with an explicit size may be initialized by a string literal with exactly

that many characters (the \0 is quietly squeezed out).

•  The  controlling  expression,  and  the  case  labels,  of  a  switch  may  have  any  integral

type.
