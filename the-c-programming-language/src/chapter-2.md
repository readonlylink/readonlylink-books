title: Chapter 2
subtitle: Types, Operators and Expressions
---

Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a
program. Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what
type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.  Operators
specify what is to be done to them.  Expressions combine variables and
constants to produce new values.  The type of an object determines the
set of values it can have and what operations can be performed on
it. These building blocks are the topics of this chapter.

The ANSI standard has made many small changes and additions to basic
types and expressions. There are now `signed` and `unsigned` forms of
all integer types, and notations for unsigned constants and
hexadecimal character constants.  Floating-point operations may be
done in single precision; there is also a `long double` type for
extended precision.  String constants may be concatenated at compile
time.  Enumerations have become part of the language, formalizing a
feature of long standing.  Objects may be declared `const`, which
prevents them from being changed. The rules for automatic coercions
among arithmetic types have been augmented to handle the richer set of
types.

# 2.1 Variable Names

Although we didn't say so in Chapter 1, there are some restrictions on
the names of variables and symbolic constants. Names are made up of
letters and digits; the first character must be a letter.  The
underscore "_" counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for
improving the readability of long variable names.  Don't begin
variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often
use such names. Upper and lower case letters are distinct, so x and X
are two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case
for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants.

At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant.
For function names and external variables, the number may be less than
31, because external names may be used by assemblers and loaders over
which the language has no control.  For external names, the standard
guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case.
Keywords like `if`, `else`, `int`, `float`, etc., are reserved: you
can't use them as variable names. They must be in lower case.

It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of
the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed up typographically.
We tend to use short names for local variables, especially loop
indices, and longer names for external variables.

# 2.2 Data Types and Sizes

There are only a few basic data types in C:

| type     | meaning                                                                           |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `char`   | a single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set        |
| `int`    | an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine |
| `float`  | single-precision floating point                                                   |
| `double` | double-precision floating point                                                   |

In addition, there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied to
these basic types.  `short` and `long` apply to integers:

```c
short int sh;
long int counter;
```

The word `int` can be omitted in such declarations,
and typically it is.

The intent is that `short` and `long` should provide different lengths
of integers where practical; `int` will normally be the natural size
for a particular machine. `short` is often 16 bits, `long`, and `int`
either 16 or 32 bits.  Each compiler is free to choose appropriate
sizes for its own hardware, subject only to the the restriction that
`short`s and `int`s are at least 16 bits, `long`s are at least 32
bits, and `short` is no longer than `int`, which is no longer than
`long`.

The qualifier `signed` or `unsigned` may be applied to `char` or any
integer. unsigned numbers are always positive or zero, and obey the
laws of arithmetic modulo 2^n, where n is the number of bits in the
type. So, for instance, if `char`s are 8 bits, `unsigned char`
variables have values between 0 and 255, while `signed char`s have
values between -128 and 127 (in a two's complement machine.)  Whether
plain `char`s are signed or unsigned is machine-dependent, but
printable characters are always positive.

The type `long double` specifies extended-precision floating point. As
with integers, the sizes of floating-point objects are
implementation-defined; `float`, `double` and `long double` could
represent one, two or three distinct sizes.

The standard headers `<limits.h>` and `<float.h>` contain symbolic
constants for all of these sizes, along with other properties of the
machine and compiler.  These are discussed in Appendix B.

**Exercise 2-1**.  Write a program to determine the ranges of `char`,
`short`, `int`, and `long` variables, both `signed` and `unsigned`, by
printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct
computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the
various floating-point types.

# 2.3 Constants

An integer constant like `1234` is an `int`. A `long` constant is
written with a terminal `l` (ell) or `L`, as in `123456789L`; an
integer constant too big to fit into an `int` will also be taken as a
`long`.  Unsigned constants are written with a terminal `u` or `U`,
and the suffix `ul` or `UL` indicates `unsigned long`.

Floating-point constants contain a decimal point (`123.4`) or an
exponent (`1e-2`) or both; their type is `double`, unless
suffixed. The suffixes `f` or `F` indicate a `float` constant; `l` or
`L` indicate a `long double`.

The value of an integer can be specified in octal or hexadecimal
instead of decimal. A leading `0` (zero) on an integer constant means
octal; a leading `0x` or `0X` means hexadecimal.  For example, decimal
31 can be written as `037` in octal and `0x1f` or `0x1F` in hex.
Octal and hexadecimal constants may also be followed by `L` to make
them `long` and `U` to make them `unsigned`: `0XFUL` is an `unsigned
long` constant with value 15 decimal.

A _character_ constant is an integer, written as one character within
single quotes, such as `'x'`. The value of a character constant is the
numeric value of the character in the machine's character set. For
example, in the ASCII character set the character constant `'0'` has
the value 48, which is unrelated to the numeric value `0`. If we write
`'0'` instead of a numeric value like 48 that depends on the character
set, the program is independent of the particular value and easier to
read. Character constants participate in numeric operations just as
any other integers, although they are most often used in comparisons
with other characters.

Certain characters can be represented in character and string
constants by escape sequences like `\n` (newline); these sequences
look like two characters, but represent only one.  In addition, an
arbitrary byte-sized bit pattern can be specified by

```c
'\ooo'
```

where _ooo_ is one to three octal digits (0...7) or by

```c
'\xhh'
```

where _hh_ is one or more hexadecimal digits (0...9, a...f, A...F).
So we might write

```c
#define VTAB '\013'   /* ASCII vertical tab */
#define BELL '\007'   /* ASCII bell character */
```

or, in hexadecimal,

```c
#define VTAB '\xb'   /* ASCII vertical tab */
#define BELL '\x7'   /* ASCII bell character */
```

The complete set of escape sequences is

| char   | meaning                |
|--------|------------------------|
| `\a`   | alert (bell) character |
| `\b`   | backspace              |
| `\f`   | formfeed               |
| `\n`   | newline                |
| `\r`   | carriage return        |
| `\t`   | horizontal tab         |
| `\v`   | vertical tab           |
| `\\`   | backslash              |
| `\?`   | question mark          |
| `\'`   | single quote           |
| `\"`   | double quote           |
| `\ooo` | octal number           |
| `\xhh` | hexadecimal number     |

The character constant `'\0'` represents the character with value
zero, the null character. `'\0'` is often written instead of `0` to
emphasize the character nature of some expression, but the numeric
value is just 0.

A _constant expression_ is an expression that involves only
constants. Such expressions may be evaluated at during compilation
rather than run-time, and accordingly may be used in any place that a
constant can occur, as in

```c
#define MAXLINE 1000
char line[MAXLINE+1];
```

or

```c
#define LEAP 1 /* in leap years */
int days[31+28+LEAP+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31];
```

A _string constant_, or _string literal_, is a sequence of zero or
more characters surrounded by double quotes, as in

```c
"I am a string"
```

or

```c
"" /* the empty string */
```

The quotes are not part of the string, but serve only to delimit
it. The same escape sequences used in character constants apply in
strings; `\"` represents the double-quote character. String constants
can be concatenated at compile time:

```c
"hello, " "world"
```

is equivalent to

```c
"hello, world"
```

This is useful for splitting up long strings across several source lines.

Technically, a string constant is an array of characters. The internal
representation of a string has a null character `'\0'` at the end, so
the physical storage required is one more than the number of
characters written between the quotes. This representation means that
there is no limit to how long a string can be, but programs must scan
a string completely to determine its length.  The standard library
function `strlen(s)` returns the length of its character string
argument `s`, excluding the terminal `'\0'`. Here is our version:

```c
/* strlen:  return length of s */
int strlen(char s[])
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while (s[i] != '\0')
        ++i;
    return i;
}
```

`strlen` and other string functions are declared in the standard
header `<string.h>`.

Be careful to distinguish between a character constant and a string
that contains a single character: `'x'` is not the same as `"x"`. The
former is an integer, used to produce the numeric value of the letter
x in the machine's character set.  The latter is an array of
characters that contains one character (the letter x) and a `'\0'`.

There is one other kind of constant, the _enumeration constant_.
An enumeration is a list of constant integer values, as in

```c
enum boolean { NO, YES };
```

The first name in an enum has value 0, the next 1, and so on, unless
explicit values are specified. If not all values are specified,
unspecified values continue the progression from the last specified
value, as the second of these examples:

```c
enum escapes { BELL = '\a', BACKSPACE = '\b', TAB = '\t',
               NEWLINE = '\n', VTAB = '\v', RETURN = '\r' };

enum months { JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN,
              JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC };
                    /* FEB = 2, MAR = 3, etc. */
```

Names in different enumerations must be distinct.  Values need not be
distinct in the same enumeration.

Enumerations provide a convenient way to associate constant values
with names, an alternative to `#define` with the advantage that the
values can be generated for you. Although variables of `enum` types
may be declared, compilers need not check that what you store in such
a variable is a valid value for the enumeration. Nevertheless,
enumeration variables offer the chance of checking and so are often
better than `#define`s. In addition, a debugger may be able to print
values of enumeration variables in their symbolic form.

# 2.4 Declarations

All variables must be declared before use, although certain
declarations can be made implicitly by content.  A declaration
specifies a type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that
type, as in

```c
int  lower, upper, step;
char c, line[1000];
```

Variables can be distributed among declarations in any fashion; the
lists above could well be written as

```c
int  lower;
int  upper;
int  step;
char c;
char line[1000];
```

The latter form takes more space, but is convenient for adding a
comment to each declaration for subsequent modifications.

A variable may also be initialized in its declaration. If the name is
followed by an equals sign and an expression, the expression serves as
an initializer, as in

```c
char  esc = '\\';
int   i = 0;
int   limit = MAXLINE+1;
float eps = 1.0e-5;
```

If the variable in question is not automatic, the initialization is
done once only, conceptionally before the program starts executing,
and the initializer must be a constant expression.  An explicitly
initialized automatic variable is initialized each time the function
or block it is in is entered; the initializer may be any
expression. External and static variables are initialized to zero by
default. Automatic variables for which is no explicit initializer have
undefined (i.e., garbage) values.

The qualifier `const` can be applied to the declaration of any
variable to specify that its value will not be changed.  For an array,
the `const` qualifier says that the elements will not be altered.

```c
const double e = 2.71828182845905;
const char msg[] = "warning: ";
```

The `const` declaration can also be used with array arguments,
to indicate that the function does not change that array:

```c
int strlen(const char[]);
```

The result is implementation-defined if an attempt is made to change a `const`.

# 2.5 Arithmetic Operators

The binary arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and the
modulus operator `%`.  Integer division truncates any fractional
part. The expression

```c
x % y
```

produces the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`, and thus is zero
when `y` divides `x` exactly. For example, a year is a leap year if it
is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except that years divisible by 400
are leap years. Therefore

```c
if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0)
    printf("%d is a leap year\n", year);
else
    printf("%d is not a leap year\n", year);
```

The `%` operator cannot be applied to a `float` or `double`. The
direction of truncation for `/` and the sign of the result for `%` are
machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the action taken on
overflow or underflow.

The binary `+` and `-` operators have the same precedence, which is
lower than the precedence of `*`, `/` and `%`, which is in turn lower
than unary `+` and `-`. Arithmetic operators associate left to right.

Table 2-1 at the end of this chapter summarizes precedence and
associativity for all operators.

# 2.6 Relational and Logical Operators

The relational operators are

```
>   >=   <   <=
```

They all have the same precedence. Just below them in precedence are
the equality operators:

```
==   !=
```

Relational operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators,
so an expression like `i < lim-1` is taken as `i < (lim-1)`, as would be
expected.

More interesting are the logical operators `&&` and `||`. Expressions
connected by `&&` or `||` are evaluated left to right, and evaluation
stops as soon as the truth or falsehood of the result is known. Most C
programs rely on these properties. For example, here is a loop from
the input function `getline` that we wrote in Chapter 1:

```c
for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
    s[i] = c;
```

Before reading a new character it is necessary to check that there is
room to store it in the array `s`, so the test `i < lim-1` _must_ be
made first. Moreover, if this test fails, we must not go on and read
another character.

Similarly, it would be unfortunate if `c` were tested against `EOF`
before `getchar` is called; therefore the call and assignment must
occur before the character in `c` is tested.

The precedence of `&&` is higher than that of `||`, and both are lower
than relational and equality operators, so expressions like

```c
i < lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF
```

need no extra parentheses.  But since the precedence of `!=` is higher
than assignment, parentheses are needed in

```c
(c=getchar()) != '\n'
```

to achieve the desired result of assignment to `c` and then comparison
with `'\n'`.

By definition, the numeric value of a relational or logical expression
is 1 if the relation is true, and 0 if the relation is false.

The unary negation operator `!` converts a non-zero operand into 0,
and a zero operand in 1. A common use of `!` is in constructions like

```c
if (!valid)
```

rather than

```c
if (valid == 0)
```

It's hard to generalize about which form is better. Constructions like
`!valid` read nicely ("if not valid"), but more complicated ones can
be hard to understand.

**Exercise 2-2**. Write a loop equivalent to the `for` loop above
without using `&&` or `||`.

# 2.7 Type Conversions

When  an  operator  has  operands  of  different  types,  they  are  converted  to  a  common  type
according to a small number of rules. In general, the only automatic conversions are those that
convert  a  "narrower"  operand  into  a  "wider"  one  without  losing  information,  such  as
converting an integer into floating point in an expression like f + i. Expressions that don't
make  sense,  like  using  a  float  as  a  subscript,  are  disallowed.  Expressions  that  might  lose
information,  like  assigning  a  longer  integer  type  to  a  shorter,  or  a  floating-point  type  to  an
integer, may draw a warning, but they are not illegal.

A  char  is  just  a  small  integer,  so  chars  may  be  freely  used  in  arithmetic  expressions.  This
permits  considerable  flexibility  in  certain  kinds  of  character  transformations.  One  is
exemplified  by  this  naive  implementation  of  the  function  atoi,  which  converts  a  string  of
digits into its numeric equivalent.

   /* atoi:  convert s to integer */
   int atoi(char s[])
   {
       int i, n;

       n = 0;
       for (i = 0; s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9'; ++i)
           n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0');
       return n;
   }
As we discussed in Chapter 1, the expression










    s[i] - '0'
gives the numeric value of the character stored in s[i], because the values of '0', '1', etc.,
form a contiguous increasing sequence.

Another  example  of  char  to  int  conversion  is  the  function  lower,  which  maps  a  single
character to lower case for the ASCII character set. If the character is not an upper case letter,
lower returns it unchanged.

42

   /* lower:  convert c to lower case; ASCII only */
   int lower(int c)
   {
       if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
           return c + 'a' - 'A';
       else
           return c;
   }
This  works  for  ASCII  because  corresponding  upper  case  and  lower  case  letters  are  a  fixed
distance apart as numeric values and each alphabet is contiguous -- there is nothing but letters
between A and Z. This latter observation is not true of the EBCDIC character set, however, so
this code would convert more than just letters in EBCDIC.

The standard header <ctype.h>, described in Appendix B, defines a family of functions that
provide tests and conversions that are independent of character set. For example, the function
tolower is a portable replacement for the function lower shown above. Similarly, the test

   c >= '0' && c <= '9'
can be replaced by

   isdigit(c)
We will use the <ctype.h> functions from now on.

There  is  one  subtle  point  about  the  conversion of characters to integers. The language does
not specify whether variables of type char are signed or unsigned quantities. When a char is
converted to an int, can it ever produce a negative integer? The answer varies from machine
to machine, reflecting differences in architecture. On some machines a char whose leftmost
bit  is  1  will  be  converted  to  a  negative  integer  ("sign  extension").  On  others,  a  char  is
promoted to an int by adding zeros at the left end, and thus is always positive.

The definition of C guarantees that any character in the machine's standard printing character
set  will  never  be  negative,  so  these  characters  will  always  be  positive  quantities  in
expressions. But arbitrary bit patterns stored in character variables may appear to be negative
on some machines, yet positive on others. For portability, specify signed or unsigned if non-
character data is to be stored in char variables.

Relational expressions like i > j and logical expressions connected by && and || are defined
to have value 1 if true, and 0 if false. Thus the assignment

   d = c >= '0' && c <= '9'
sets d to 1 if c is a digit, and 0 if not. However, functions like isdigit may return any non-
zero value for true. In the test part of if, while, for, etc., "true" just means "non-zero", so
this makes no difference.







Implicit arithmetic conversions work much as expected. In general, if an operator like + or *
that takes two operands (a binary operator) has operands of different types, the "lower" type
is  promoted  to  the  "higher"  type  before  the  operation  proceeds.  The  result  is  of  the  integer
type. Section 6 of Appendix A states the conversion rules precisely. If there are no unsigned
operands, however, the following informal set of rules will suffice:

43

If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double.
•
•  Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double.
•  Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float.
•  Otherwise, convert char and short to int.
•  Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long.

Notice  that  floats  in  an  expression  are  not  automatically  converted  to  double;  this  is  a
change from the original definition. In general, mathematical functions like those in <math.h>
will use double precision. The main reason for using float is to save storage in large arrays,
or,  less  often,  to  save  time  on  machines  where  double-precision  arithmetic  is  particularly
expensive.

Conversion rules are more complicated when unsigned operands are involved. The problem
is that comparisons between signed and unsigned values are machine-dependent, because they
depend on the sizes of the various integer types. For example, suppose that int is 16 bits and
long  is  32  bits.  Then  -1L  <  1U,  because  1U,  which  is  an  unsigned  int,  is  promoted  to  a
signed long. But -1L > 1UL because -1L is promoted to unsigned long and thus appears
to be a large positive number.

Conversions take place across assignments; the value of the right side is converted to the type
of the left, which is the type of the result.

A character is converted to an integer, either by sign extension or not, as described above.

Longer integers are converted to shorter ones or to chars by dropping the excess high-order
bits. Thus in

   int  i;
   char c;

   i = c;
   c = i;
the value of c is unchanged. This is true whether or not sign extension is involved. Reversing
the order of assignments might lose information, however.

If  x  is  float  and  i  is  int,  then  x  =  i  and  i  =  x  both  cause  conversions;  float  to  int
causes truncation of any fractional part. When a  double is converted to  float, whether the
value is rounded or truncated is implementation dependent.

Since an argument of a function call is an expression, type conversion also takes place when
arguments  are  passed  to  functions.  In  the  absence  of  a  function  prototype,  char  and  short
become int, and float becomes double. This is why we have declared function arguments to
be int and double even when the function is called with char and float.

Finally, explicit type conversions can be forced ("coerced") in any expression, with a unary
operator called a cast. In the construction





  (type name) expression

the  expression  is  converted  to  the  named  type  by  the  conversion  rules  above.  The  precise
meaning  of  a  cast  is  as  if  the  expression  were  assigned  to  a  variable  of  the  specified  type,
which is then used in place of the whole construction. For example, the library routine sqrt
expects  a  double  argument,  and  will  produce  nonsense  if  inadvertently  handled  something
else. (sqrt is declared in <math.h>.) So if n is an integer, we can use

44

   sqrt((double) n)
to convert the value of n to double before passing it to sqrt. Note that the cast produces the
value  of  n  in  the  proper  type;  n  itself  is  not  altered.  The  cast  operator  has  the  same  high
precedence as other unary operators, as summarized in the table at the end of this chapter.

If arguments are declared by a function prototype, as the normally should be, the declaration
causes  automatic  coercion  of  any  arguments  when  the  function  is  called.  Thus,  given  a
function prototype for sqrt:

   double sqrt(double)
the call

   root2 = sqrt(2)
coerces the integer 2 into the double value 2.0 without any need for a cast.

The  standard  library  includes  a  portable  implementation  of  a  pseudo-random  number
generator and a function for initializing the seed; the former illustrates a cast:

   unsigned long int next = 1;

   /* rand:  return pseudo-random integer on 0..32767 */
   int rand(void)
   {
       next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
       return (unsigned int)(next/65536) % 32768;
   }

   /* srand:  set seed for rand() */
   void srand(unsigned int seed)
   {
       next = seed;
   }
Exercise  2-3.  Write  a  function  htoi(s),  which  converts  a  string  of  hexadecimal  digits
(including an optional 0x or  0X) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0
through 9, a through f, and A through F.

# 2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators

C  provides  two  unusual  operators  for  incrementing  and  decrementing  variables.  The
increment operator ++ adds 1 to its operand, while the decrement operator -- subtracts 1. We
have frequently used ++ to increment variables, as in

   if (c == '\n')
       ++nl;










The  unusual  aspect  is  that  ++  and  --  may  be  used  either  as  prefix  operators  (before  the
variable, as in ++n), or postfix operators (after the variable: n++). In both cases, the effect is to
increment  n.  But  the  expression  ++n  increments  n  before  its  value  is  used,  while  n++
increments  n  after  its  value  has  been  used.  This  means  that  in  a  context  where  the  value  is
being used, not just the effect, ++n and n++ are different. If n is 5, then

45

   x = n++;
sets x to 5, but

   x = ++n;
sets x to 6. In both cases, n becomes 6. The increment and decrement operators can only be
applied to variables; an expression like (i+j)++ is illegal.

In a context where no value is wanted, just the incrementing effect, as in

   if (c == '\n')
       nl++;
prefix and postfix are the same. But there are situations where one or the other is specifically
called for. For instance, consider the function squeeze(s,c), which removes all occurrences
of the character c from the string s.

   /* squeeze:  delete all c from s */
   void squeeze(char s[], int c)
   {
      int i, j;

      for (i = j = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
          if (s[i] != c)
              s[j++] = s[i];
      s[j] = '\0';
   }
Each  time  a  non-c  occurs,  it  is  copied  into  the  current  j  position,  and  only  then  is  j
incremented to be ready for the next character. This is exactly equivalent to

   if (s[i] != c) {
       s[j] = s[i];
       j++;
   }
Another example of a similar construction comes from the getline function that we wrote in
Chapter 1, where we can replace

   if (c == '\n') {
       s[i] = c;
       ++i;
   }
by the more compact

   if (c == '\n')
      s[i++] = c;
As  a  third  example,  consider  the  standard  function  strcat(s,t),  which  concatenates  the
string  t  to  the  end  of  string  s.  strcat  assumes  that  there  is  enough  space  in  s  to  hold  the
combination.  As  we  have  written  it,  strcat  returns  no  value;  the  standard  library  version
returns a pointer to the resulting string.

   /* strcat:  concatenate t to end of s; s must be big enough */
   void strcat(char s[], char t[])
   {

       int i, j;

       i = j = 0;
       while (s[i] != '\0') /* find end of s */
           i++;
       while ((s[i++] = t[j++]) != '\0') /* copy t */
           ;
   }
As each member is copied from t to s, the postfix ++ is applied to both i and j to make sure
that they are in position for the next pass through the loop.

Exercise 2-4. Write an alternative version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in
s1 that matches any character in the string s2.

Exercise 2-5. Write the function  any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in a string  s1
where  any  character  from  the  string  s2  occurs,  or  -1  if  s1  contains  no  characters  from  s2.
(The  standard  library  function  strpbrk  does  the  same  job  but  returns  a  pointer  to  the
location.)

# 2.9 Bitwise Operators

C provides six operators for bit manipulation; these may only be applied to integral operands,
that is, char, short, int, and long, whether signed or unsigned.
&
|
^

bitwise inclusive OR

bitwise exclusive OR

bitwise AND

<<    left shift
>>  right shift
~

one's complement (unary)

The bitwise AND operator & is often used to mask off some set of bits, for example

   n = n & 0177;
sets to zero all but the low-order 7 bits of n.

The bitwise OR operator | is used to turn bits on:

   x = x | SET_ON;
sets to one in x the bits that are set to one in SET_ON.

The bitwise exclusive OR operator ^ sets a one in each bit position where its operands have
different bits, and zero where they are the same.

One  must  distinguish  the  bitwise  operators  &  and  |  from  the  logical  operators  &&  and  ||,
which imply left-to-right evaluation of a truth value. For example, if x is 1 and y is 2, then x
& y is zero while x && y is one.

The shift operators << and >> perform left and right shifts of their left operand by the number
of bit positions given by the right operand, which must be non-negative. Thus x << 2 shifts






the  value  of  x  by  two  positions,  filling  vacated  bits  with  zero;  this  is  equivalent  to
multiplication  by  4.  Right  shifting  an  unsigned  quantity  always  fits  the  vacated  bits  with
zero.  Right  shifting  a  signed  quantity  will  fill  with  bit  signs  ("arithmetic  shift")  on  some
machines and with 0-bits ("logical shift") on others.

The unary operator ~ yields the one's complement of an integer; that is, it converts each 1-bit
into a 0-bit and vice versa. For example


   x = x & ~077
sets the last six bits of  x to zero. Note that  x  &  ~077 is independent of word length, and is
thus preferable to, for example, x & 0177700, which assumes that x is a 16-bit quantity. The
portable form involves no extra cost, since ~077 is a constant expression that can be evaluated
at compile time.

As  an  illustration  of  some  of  the  bit  operators,  consider  the  function  getbits(x,p,n)  that
returns  the  (right  adjusted)  n-bit  field  of  x  that  begins  at  position  p.  We  assume  that  bit
position  0  is  at  the  right  end  and  that  n  and  p  are  sensible  positive  values.  For  example,
getbits(x,4,3) returns the three bits in positions 4, 3 and 2, right-adjusted.

   /* getbits:  get n bits from position p */
   unsigned getbits(unsigned x, int p, int n)
   {
       return (x >> (p+1-n)) & ~(~0 << n);
   }
The expression x >> (p+1-n) moves the desired field to the right end of the word. ~0 is all
1-bits;  shifting  it  left  n  positions  with  ~0<<n  places  zeros  in  the  rightmost  n  bits;
complementing that with ~ makes a mask with ones in the rightmost n bits.

Exercise 2-6. Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that begin at
position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.

Exercise  2-7.  Write  a  function  invert(x,p,n)  that  returns  x  with  the  n  bits  that  begin  at
position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged.

Exercise 2-8. Write a function rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated
to the right by n positions.

# 2.10 Assignment Operators and Expressions

An expression such as

   i = i + 2
in which the variable on the left side is repeated immediately on the right, can be written in
the compressed form

   i += 2
The operator += is called an assignment operator.

Most  binary  operators  (operators  like  +  that  have  a  left  and  right  operand)  have  a
corresponding assignment operator op=, where op is one of


   +   -   *   /   %   <<   >>   &   ^   |
If expr1 and expr2 are expressions, then

   expr1 op= expr2
is equivalent to

   expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2)
except that expr1 is computed only once. Notice the parentheses around expr2:

   x *= y + 1
means

   x = x * (y + 1)
rather than

   x = x * y + 1
As an example, the function bitcount counts the number of 1-bits in its integer argument.

   /* bitcount:  count 1 bits in x */
   int bitcount(unsigned x)
   {
       int b;

       for (b = 0; x != 0; x >>= 1)
           if (x & 01)
               b++;
       return b;
   }
Declaring the argument x to be an unsigned ensures that when it is right-shifted, vacated bits
will be filled with zeros, not sign bits, regardless of the machine the program is run on.

Quite apart from conciseness, assignment operators have the advantage that they correspond
better to the way people think. We say "add 2 to i" or "increment i by 2", not "take i, add
2,  then  put  the  result  back  in  i".  Thus  the  expression  i  +=  2  is  preferable  to  i  =  i+2.  In
addition, for a complicated expression like

   yyval[yypv[p3+p4] + yypv[p1]] += 2
the assignment operator makes the code easier to understand, since the reader doesn't have to
check painstakingly that two long expressions are indeed the same, or to wonder why they're
not. And an assignment operator may even help a compiler to produce efficient code.

We have already seen that the assignment statement has a value and can occur in expressions;
the most common example is

   while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
       ...
The other assignment operators (+=,  -=, etc.) can also occur in expressions, although this is
less frequent.

In all such expressions, the type of an assignment expression is the type of its left operand,
and the value is the value after the assignment.

Exercise 2-9. In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost 1-bit
in x. Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster version of bitcount.















# 2.11 Conditional Expressions

The statements

   if (a > b)
       z = a;
   else
       z = b;
compute in z the maximum of a and b. The conditional expression, written with the ternary
operator  "?:",  provides  an  alternate  way  to  write  this  and  similar  constructions.  In  the
expression

   expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
the  expression  expr1  is  evaluated  first.  If  it  is  non-zero  (true),  then  the  expression  expr2  is
evaluated,  and  that  is  the  value  of  the  conditional  expression.  Otherwise expr3 is evaluated,
and that is the value. Only one of expr2 and expr3 is evaluated. Thus to set z to the maximum
of a and b,

   z = (a > b) ? a : b;    /* z = max(a, b) */
It should be noted that the conditional expression is indeed an expression, and it can be used
wherever any other expression can be. If expr2 and expr3 are of different types, the type of the
result is determined by the conversion rules discussed earlier in this chapter. For example, if f
is a float and n an int, then the expression

   (n > 0) ? f : n
is of type float regardless of whether n is positive.

Parentheses  are  not  necessary  around  the  first  expression  of  a  conditional  expression,  since
the  precedence  of  ?:  is  very  low,  just  above  assignment.  They  are  advisable  anyway,
however, since they make the condition part of the expression easier to see.

The  conditional  expression  often  leads  to  succinct  code.  For  example,  this  loop  prints  n
elements of an array, 10 per line, with each column separated by one blank, and with each line
(including the last) terminated by a newline.

   for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
       printf("%6d%c", a[i], (i%10==9 || i==n-1) ? '\n' : ' ');
A  newline  is  printed  after  every  tenth  element,  and  after  the  n-th.  All  other  elements  are
followed by one blank. This might look tricky, but it's more compact than the equivalent if-
else. Another good example is

   printf("You have %d items%s.\n", n, n==1 ? "" : "s");
Exercise 2-10. Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower case,
with a conditional expression instead of if-else.

# 2.12 Precedence and Order of Evaluation

Table  2.1  summarizes  the  rules  for  precedence  and  associativity  of  all  operators,  including
those that we have not yet discussed. Operators on the same line have the same precedence;
rows  are  in  order  of  decreasing  precedence,  so,  for  example,  *,  /,  and  %  all  have  the  same
precedence, which is higher than that of binary + and -. The "operator" () refers to function
call. The operators -> and . are used to access members of structures; they will be covered in









Chapter 6, along with sizeof (size of an object). Chapter 5 discusses * (indirection through a
pointer) and & (address of an object), and Chapter 3 discusses the comma operator.

Table 2.1: Precedence and Associativity of Operators

Note  that  the  precedence  of  the  bitwise  operators  &,  ^,  and  |  falls  below  ==  and  !=.  This
implies that bit-testing expressions like

   if ((x & MASK) == 0) ...
must be fully parenthesized to give proper results.

C, like most languages, does not specify the order in which the operands of an operator are
evaluated. (The exceptions are &&, ||, ?:, and `,'.) For example, in a statement like

   x = f() + g();
f may be evaluated before g or vice versa; thus if either f or g alters a variable on which the
other depends, x can depend on the order of evaluation. Intermediate results can be stored in
temporary variables to ensure a particular sequence.

Similarly,  the  order  in  which  function  arguments  are  evaluated  is  not  specified,  so  the
statement

   printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n));   /* WRONG */
can produce different results with different compilers, depending on whether n is incremented
before power is called. The solution, of course, is to write

   ++n;


   printf("%d %d\n", n, power(2, n));
Function  calls,  nested  assignment  statements,  and  increment  and  decrement  operators  cause
"side effects" - some variable is changed as a by-product of the evaluation of an expression.
In  any  expression  involving  side  effects,  there  can  be  subtle  dependencies  on  the  order  in
which variables taking part in the expression are updated. One unhappy situation is typified
by the statement

   a[i] = i++;
The question is whether the subscript is the old value of i or the new. Compilers can interpret
this in different ways, and generate different answers depending on their interpretation. The
standard intentionally leaves most such matters unspecified. When side effects (assignment to
variables) take place within an expression is left to the discretion of the compiler, since the
best order depends strongly on machine architecture. (The standard does specify that all side
effects on arguments take effect before a function is called, but that would not help in the call
to printf above.)

The  moral  is  that  writing  code  that  depends  on  order  of  evaluation  is  a  bad  programming
practice in any language. Naturally, it is necessary to know what things to avoid, but if you
don't know how they are done on various machines, you won't be tempted to take advantage
of a particular implementation.
