A structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of
different types, grouped together under a single name for convenient
handling.  (Structures are called "records" in some languages, notably
Pascal.) Structures help to organize complicated data, particularly in
large programs, because they permit a group of related variables to be
treated as a unit instead of as separate entities.

One traditional example of a structure is the payroll record: an
employee is described by a set of attributes such as name, address,
social security number, salary, etc. Some of these in turn could be
structures: a name has several components, as does an address and even
a salary.  Another example, more typical for C, comes from graphics: a
point is a pair of coordinate, a rectangle is a pair of points, and so
on.

The main change made by the ANSI standard is to define structure
assignment - structures may be copied and assigned to, passed to
functions, and returned by functions. This has been supported by most
compilers for many years, but the properties are now precisely
defined.  Automatic structures and arrays may now also be initialized.

# 6.1 Basics of Structures

Let us create a few structures suitable for graphics. The basic object
is a point, which we will assume has an x coordinate and a y
coordinate, both integers.

TODO Picture.

The two components can be placed in a structure declared like this:

```c
struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

The keyword struct introduces a structure declaration, which is a list
of declarations enclosed in braces. An optional name called a
structure tag may follow the word struct (as with point here).  The
tag names this kind of structure, and can be used subsequently as a
shorthand for the part of the declaration in braces.

The variables named in a structure are called members.  A structure
member or tag and an ordinary (i.e., non-member) variable can have the
same name without conflict, since they can always be distinguished by
context.  Furthermore, the same member names may occur in different
structures, although as a matter of style one would normally use the
same names only for closely related objects.

A struct declaration defines a type. The right brace that terminates
the list of members may be followed by a list of variables, just as
for any basic type. That is,

```c
struct { ... } x, y, z;
```

is syntactically analogous to

```c
int x, y, z;
```

in the sense that each statement declares x, y and z to be variables
of the named type and causes space to be set aside for them.

A structure declaration that is not followed by a list of variables
reserves no storage; it merely describes a template or shape of a
structure. If the declaration is tagged, however, the tag can be used
later in definitions of instances of the structure. For example, given
the declaration of point above,

```c
struct point pt;
```

defines a variable pt which is a structure of type struct point. A
structure can be initialized by following its definition with a list
of initializers, each a constant expression, for the members:

```c
struct maxpt = { 320, 200 };
```

An automatic structure may also be initialized by assignment or by
calling a function that returns a structure of the right type.

A member of a particular structure is referred to in an expression by
a construction of the form

```
structure-name.member
```

The structure member operator "."  connects the structure name and the
member name.  To print the coordinates of the point pt, for instance,

```c
printf("%d,%d", pt.x, pt.y);
```

or to compute the distance from the origin (0,0) to pt,

```c
double dist, sqrt(double);

dist = sqrt((double)pt.x * pt.x + (double)pt.y * pt.y);
```

Structures can be nested. One representation of a rectangle is a pair
of points that denote the diagonally opposite corners:

TODO Picture

```c
struct rect {
    struct point pt1;
    struct point pt2;
};
```

The rect structure contains two point structures.
If we declare screen as

```c
struct rect screen;
```

then

```c
screen.pt1.x
```

refers to the x coordinate of the pt1 member of screen.

# 6.2 Structures and Functions

The only legal operations on a structure are copying it or assigning
to it as a unit, taking its address with &, and accessing its
members. Copy and assignment include passing arguments to functions
and returning values from functions as well. Structures may not be
compared. A structure may be initialized by a list of constant member
values; an automatic structure may also be initialized by an
assignment.

Let us investigate structures by writing some functions to manipulate
points and rectangles.  There are at least three possible approaches:
pass components separately, pass an entire structure, or pass a
pointer to it. Each has its good points and bad points.

The first function, makepoint, will take two integers and return a
point structure:

```c
/* makepoint:  make a point from x and y components */
struct point makepoint(int x, int y)
{
    struct point temp;

    temp.x = x;
    temp.y = y;
    return temp;
}
```

Notice that there is no conflict between the argument name and the
member with the same name; indeed the re-use of the names stresses the
relationship.

makepoint can now be used to initialize any structure dynamically, or
to provide structure arguments to a function:

```c
struct rect screen;

struct point middle;
struct point makepoint(int, int);

screen.pt1 = makepoint(0,0);
screen.pt2 = makepoint(XMAX, YMAX);
middle = makepoint((screen.pt1.x + screen.pt2.x)/2,
                   (screen.pt1.y + screen.pt2.y)/2);
```

The next step is a set of functions to do arithmetic on points.
For instance,

```c
/* addpoints:  add two points */
struct addpoint(struct point p1, struct point p2)
{
    p1.x += p2.x;
    p1.y += p2.y;
    return p1;
}
```

Here both the arguments and the return value are structures. We
incremented the components in p1 rather than using an explicit
temporary variable to emphasize that structure parameters are passed
by value like any others.

As another example, the function ptinrect tests whether a point is
inside a rectangle, where we have adopted the convention that a
rectangle includes its left and bottom sides but not its top and right
sides:

```c
/* ptinrect:  return 1 if p in r, 0 if not */
int ptinrect(struct point p, struct rect r)
{
    return p.x >= r.pt1.x && p.x < r.pt2.x
        && p.y >= r.pt1.y && p.y < r.pt2.y;
}
```

This assumes that the rectangle is presented in a standard form where
the pt1 coordinates are less than the pt2 coordinates. The following
function returns a rectangle guaranteed to be in canonical form:

```c
#define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define max(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

/* canonrect: canonicalize coordinates of rectangle */
struct rect canonrect(struct rect r)
{
    struct rect temp;

    temp.pt1.x = min(r.pt1.x, r.pt2.x);
    temp.pt1.y = min(r.pt1.y, r.pt2.y);
    temp.pt2.x = max(r.pt1.x, r.pt2.x);
    temp.pt2.y = max(r.pt1.y, r.pt2.y);
    return temp;
}
```

If a large structure is to be passed to a function, it is generally
more efficient to pass a pointer than to copy the whole
structure. Structure pointers are just like pointers to ordinary
variables.  The declaration

```c
struct point *pp;
```

says that pp is a pointer to a structure of type struct point. If pp
points to a point structure, *pp is the structure, and (*pp).x and
(*pp).y are the members. To use pp, we might write, for example,

```c
struct point origin, *pp;

pp = &origin;
printf("origin is (%d,%d)\n", (*pp).x, (*pp).y);
```

The parentheses are necessary in `(*pp).x` because the precedence of
the structure member operator `.`  is higher then `*`.  The expression
`*pp.x` means `*(pp.x)`, which is illegal here because `x` is not a
pointer.

Pointers to structures are so frequently used that an alternative
notation is provided as a shorthand. If p is a pointer to a structure,
then

```c
p->member-of-structure
```

refers to the particular member. So we could write instead

```c
printf("origin is (%d,%d)\n", pp->x, pp->y);
```

Both `.` and `->` associate from left to right, so if we have

```c
struct rect r, *rp = &r;
```

then these four expressions are equivalent:

```c
r.pt1.x
rp->pt1.x
(r.pt1).x
(rp->pt1).x
```

The structure operators `.` and `->`, together with () for function
calls and [] for subscripts, are at the top of the precedence
hierarchy and thus bind very tightly.  For example, given the
declaration

```c
struct {
    int len;
    char *str;
} *p;
```

then

```c
++p->len
```

increments `len`, not `p`, because the implied parenthesization is
`++(p->len)`. Parentheses can be used to alter binding: `(++p)->len`
increments `p` before accessing `len`, and `(p++)->len` increments `p`
afterward. (This last set of parentheses is unnecessary.)

In the same way, `*p->str` fetches whatever `str` points to;
`*p->str++` increments `str` after accessing whatever it points to
(just like `*s++`); `(*p->str)++` increments whatever `str` points to;
and `*p++->str` increments `p` after accessing whatever `str` points
to.

# 6.3 Arrays of Structures

Consider writing a program to count the occurrences of each C
keyword. We need an array of character strings to hold the names, and
an array of integers for the counts. One possibility is to use two
parallel arrays, keyword and keycount, as in

```c
char *keyword[NKEYS];
int keycount[NKEYS];
```

But the very fact that the arrays are parallel suggests a different
organization, an array of structures. Each keyword is a pair:

```c
char *word;
int cout;
```

and there is an array of pairs. The structure declaration

```c
struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[NKEYS];
```

declares a structure type key, defines an array keytab of structures
of this type, and sets aside storage for them. Each element of the
array is a structure. This could also be written

```c
struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
};

struct key keytab[NKEYS];
```

Since the structure keytab contains a constant set of names, it is
easiest to make it an external variable and initialize it once and for
all when it is defined.  The structure initialization is analogous to
earlier ones - the definition is followed by a list of initializers
enclosed in braces:

```c
struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[] = {
    "auto", 0,
    "break", 0,
    "case", 0,
    "char", 0,
    "const", 0,
    "continue", 0,
    "default", 0,
    /* ... */
    "unsigned", 0,
    "void", 0,
    "volatile", 0,
    "while", 0
};
```

The initializers are listed in pairs corresponding to the structure
members. It would be more precise to enclose the initializers for each
"row" or structure in braces, as in

```c
{ "auto", 0 },
{ "break", 0 },
{ "case", 0 },
...
```

but inner braces are not necessary when the initializers are simple
variables or character strings, and when all are present. As usual,
the number of entries in the array keytab will be computed if the
initializers are present and the [] is left empty.

The keyword counting program begins with the definition of
`keytab`. The main routine reads the input by repeatedly calling a
function `getword` that fetches one word at a time. Each word is
looked up in `keytab` with a version of the binary search function
that we wrote in Chapter 3. The list of keywords must be sorted in
increasing order in the table.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXWORD 100

int getword(char *, int);
int binsearch(char *, struct key *, int);

/* count C keywords */
main()
{
    int n;
    char word[MAXWORD];

    while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
        if (isalpha(word[0]))
            if ((n = binsearch(word, keytab, NKEYS)) >= 0)
                keytab[n].count++;
    for (n = 0; n < NKEYS; n++)
        if (keytab[n].count > 0)
            printf("%4d %s\n",
                keytab[n].count, keytab[n].word);
    return 0;
}

/* binsearch:  find word in tab[0]...tab[n-1] */
int binsearch(char *word, struct key tab[], int n)
{
    int cond;
    int low, high, mid;

    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low+high) / 2;
        if ((cond = strcmp(word, tab[mid].word)) < 0)
            high = mid - 1;
        else if (cond > 0)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            return mid;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

We will show the function getword in a moment; for now it suffices to
say that each call to getword finds a word, which is copied into the
array named as its first argument.

The quantity NKEYS is the number of keywords in keytab. Although we
could count this by hand, it's a lot easier and safer to do it by
machine, especially if the list is subject to change.  One possibility
would be to terminate the list of initializers with a null pointer,
then loop along keytab until the end is found.

But this is more than is needed, since the size of the array is
completely determined at compile time. The size of the array is the
size of one entry times the number of entries, so the number of
entries is just

```c
size of keytab / size of struct key
```

C provides a compile-time unary operator called sizeof that can be
used to compute the size of any object. The expressions

```c
sizeof object
```

and

```c
sizeof (type name)
```

yield an integer equal to the size of the specified object or type in
bytes.  (Strictly, sizeof produces an unsigned integer value whose
type, size_t, is defined in the header <stddef.h>.) An object can be a
variable or array or structure. A type name can be the name of a basic
type like int or double, or a derived type like a structure or a
pointer.

In our case, the number of keywords is the size of the array divided
by the size of one element. This computation is used in a #define
statement to set the value of NKEYS:

```c
#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(struct key))
```

Another way to write this is to divide the array size by the size of a
specific element:

```c
#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(keytab[0]))
```

This has the advantage that it does not need to be changed if the type
changes.

A sizeof can not be used in a #if line, because the preprocessor does
not parse type names.  But the expression in the #define is not
evaluated by the preprocessor, so the code here is legal.

Now for the function getword. We have written a more general getword
than is necessary for this program, but it is not complicated.
getword fetches the next "word" from the input, where a word is either
a string of letters and digits beginning with a letter, or a single
non- white space character. The function value is the first character
of the word, or EOF for end of file, or the character itself if it is
not alphabetic.

```c
/* getword:  get next word or character from input */
int getword(char *word, int lim)
{
    int c, getch(void);
    void ungetch(int);
    char *w = word;

    while (isspace(c = getch()))
        ;
    if (c != EOF)
        *w++ = c;
    if (!isalpha(c)) {
        *w = '\0';
        return c;
    }
    for ( ; --lim > 0; w++)
        if (!isalnum(*w = getch())) {
            ungetch(*w);
            break;
        }
    *w = '\0';
    return word[0];
}
```

getword uses the getch and ungetch that we wrote in Chapter 4. When
the collection of an alphanumeric token stops, getword has gone one
character too far.  The call to ungetch pushes that character back on
the input for the next call. getword also uses isspace to skip
whitespace, isalpha to identify letters, and isalnum to identify
letters and digits; all are from the standard header <ctype.h>.

**Exercise 6-1**. Our version of getword does not properly handle
underscores, string constants, comments, or preprocessor control
lines. Write a better version.

# 6.4 Pointers to Structures

To illustrate some of the considerations involved with pointers to and
arrays of structures, let us write the keyword-counting program again,
this time using pointers instead of array indices.

The external declaration of keytab need not change, but main and
binsearch do need modification.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXWORD 100

int getword(char *, int);
struct key *binsearch(char *, struct key *, int);

/* count C keywords; pointer version */
main()
{
    char word[MAXWORD];
    struct key *p;

    while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
        if (isalpha(word[0]))
            if ((p=binsearch(word, keytab, NKEYS)) != NULL)
                p->count++;
    for (p = keytab; p < keytab + NKEYS; p++)
        if (p->count > 0)
            printf("%4d %s\n", p->count, p->word);
    return 0;
}

/* binsearch: find word in tab[0]...tab[n-1] */
struct key *binsearch(char *word, struck key *tab, int n)
{
    int cond;
    struct key *low = &tab[0];
    struct key *high = &tab[n];
    struct key *mid;

    while (low < high) {
        mid = low + (high-low) / 2;
        if ((cond = strcmp(word, mid->word)) < 0)
            high = mid;
        else if (cond > 0)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            return mid;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

There are several things worthy of note here.  First, the declaration
of binsearch must indicate that it returns a pointer to struct key
instead of an integer; this is declared both in the function prototype
and in binsearch. If binsearch finds the word, it returns a pointer to
it; if it fails, it returns NULL.

Second, the elements of keytab are now accessed by pointers.  This
requires significant changes in binsearch.

The initializers for low and high are now pointers to the beginning
and just past the end of the table.

The computation of the middle element can no longer be simply

```c
mid = (low+high) / 2    /* WRONG */
```

because the addition of pointers is illegal. Subtraction is legal,
however, so high-low is the number of elements, and thus

```c
mid = low + (high-low) / 2
```

sets mid to the element halfway between low and high.

The most important change is to adjust the algorithm to make sure that
it does not generate an illegal pointer or attempt to access an
element outside the array. The problem is that &tab[- 1] and &tab[n]
are both outside the limits of the array tab. The former is strictly
illegal, and it is illegal to dereference the latter.  The language
definition does guarantee, however, that pointer arithmetic that
involves the first element beyond the end of an array (that is,
&tab[n]) will work correctly.

In main we wrote

```c
for (p = keytab; p < keytab + NKEYS; p++)
```

If p is a pointer to a structure, arithmetic on p takes into account
the size of the structure, so p++ increments p by the correct amount
to get the next element of the array of structures, and the test stops
the loop at the right time.

Don't assume, however, that the size of a structure is the sum of the
sizes of its members.  Because of alignment requirements for different
objects, there may be unnamed "holes" in a structure. Thus, for
instance, if a char is one byte and an int four bytes, the structure

```c
struct {
    char c;
    int i;
};
```

might well require eight bytes, not five. The sizeof operator returns
the proper value.

Finally, an aside on program format: when a function returns a
complicated type like a structure pointer, as in

```c
struct key *binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n)
```

the function name can be hard to see, and to find with a text
editor. Accordingly an alternate style is sometimes used:

```c
struct key *
binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n)
```

This is a matter of personal taste; pick the form you like and hold to it.

# 6.5 Self-referential Structures

Suppose we want to handle the more general problem of counting the
occurrences of all the words in some input.  Since the list of words
isn't known in advance, we can't conveniently sort it and use a binary
search. Yet we can't do a linear search for each word as it arrives,
to see if it's already been seen; the program would take too long.
(More precisely, its running time is likely to grow quadratically with
the number of input words.) How can we organize the data to copy
efficiently with a list or arbitrary words?

One solution is to keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all
times, by placing each word into its proper position in the order as
it arrives. This shouldn't be done by shifting words in a linear
array, though - that also takes too long.  Instead we will use a data
structure called a binary tree.

The tree contains one "node" per distinct word; each node contains

-  A pointer to the text of the word,
-  A count of the number of occurrences,
-  A pointer to the left child node,
-  A pointer to the right child node.

No node may have more than two children; it might have only zero or one.

The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains
only words that are lexicographically less than the word at the node,
and the right subtree contains only words that are greater. This is
the tree for the sentence "now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their party", as built by inserting each word as it is
encountered:

TODO Picture.

To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the
root and compare the new word to the word stored at that node. If they
match, the question is answered affirmatively. If the new record is
less than the tree word, continue searching at the left child,
otherwise at the right child. If there is no child in the required
direction, the new word is not in the tree, and in fact the empty slot
is the proper place to add the new word. This process is recursive,
since the search from any node uses a search from one of its children.
Accordingly, recursive routines for insertion and printing will be
most natural.

Going back to the description of a node, it is most conveniently
represented as a structure with four components:

```c
struct tnode {     /* the tree node: */
    char *word;           /* points to the text */
    int count;            /* number of occurrences */
    struct tnode *left;   /* left child */
    struct tnode *right;  /* right child */
};
```

This recursive declaration of a node might look chancy, but it's
correct.  It is illegal for a structure to contain an instance of
itself, but

```c
struct tnode *left;
```

declares left to be a pointer to a tnode, not a tnode itself.

Occasionally, one needs a variation of self-referential structures:
two structures that refer to each other. The way to handle this is:

```c
struct t {
    ...
    struct s *p;   /* p points to an s */
};
struct s {
    ...
    struct t *q;   /* q points to a t */
};
```

The code for the whole program is surprisingly small, given a handful
of supporting routines like getword that we have already written. The
main routine reads words with getword and installs them in the tree
with addtree.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXWORD 100
struct tnode *addtree(struct tnode *, char *);
void treeprint(struct tnode *);
int getword(char *, int);

/* word frequency count */
main()
{
    struct tnode *root;
    char word[MAXWORD];

    root = NULL;
    while (getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
        if (isalpha(word[0]))
            root = addtree(root, word);
    treeprint(root);
    return 0;
}
```

The function addtree is recursive. A word is presented by main to the top level (the root) of
the tree. At each stage, that word is compared to the word already stored at the node, and is
percolated down to either the left or right subtree by a recursive call to adtree. Eventually,
the  word  either  matches  something  already  in  the  tree  (in  which  case  the  count  is
incremented),  or  a  null  pointer  is  encountered,  indicating  that  a  node  must  be  created  and
added to the tree. If a new node is created, addtree returns a pointer to it, which is installed
in the parent node.

```c
struct tnode *talloc(void);

char *strdup(char *);

/* addtree:  add a node with w, at or below p */
struct treenode *addtree(struct tnode *p, char *w)
{
    int cond;

    if (p == NULL) {     /* a new word has arrived */
        p = talloc();    /* make a new node */
        p->word = strdup(w);
        p->count = 1;
        p->left = p->right = NULL;
    } else if ((cond = strcmp(w, p->word)) == 0)
        p->count++;      /* repeated word */
    else if (cond < 0)   /* less than into left subtree */
        p->left = addtree(p->left, w);
    else             /* greater than into right subtree */
        p->right = addtree(p->right, w);
    return p;
}
```

Storage for the new node is fetched by a routine talloc, which returns
a pointer to a free space suitable for holding a tree node, and the
new word is copied into a hidden space by strdup. (We will discuss
these routines in a moment.) The count is initialized, and the two
children are made null. This part of the code is executed only at the
leaves of the tree, when a new node is being added. We have (unwisely)
omitted error checking on the values returned by strdup and talloc.

treeprint prints the tree in sorted order; at each node, it prints the
left subtree (all the words less than this word), then the word
itself, then the right subtree (all the words greater). If you feel
shaky about how recursion works, simulate treeprint as it operates on
the tree shown above.

```c
/* treeprint:  in-order print of tree p */
void treeprint(struct tnode *p)
{
    if (p != NULL) {
        treeprint(p->left);
        printf("%4d %s\n", p->count, p->word);
        treeprint(p->right);
    }
}
```

A practical note: if the tree becomes "unbalanced" because the words
don't arrive in random order, the running time of the program can grow
too much. As a worst case, if the words are already in order, this
program does an expensive simulation of linear search.  There are
generalizations of the binary tree that do not suffer from this
worst-case behavior, but we will not describe them here.

Before leaving this example, it is also worth a brief digression on a
problem related to storage allocators.  Clearly it's desirable that
there be only one storage allocator in a program, even though it
allocates different kinds of objects. But if one allocator is to
process requests for, say, pointers to chars and pointers to struct
tnodes, two questions arise. First, how does it meet the requirement
of most real machines that objects of certain types must satisfy
alignment restrictions (for example, integers often must be located at
even addresses)?  Second, what declarations can cope with the fact
that an allocator must necessarily return different kinds of pointers?

Alignment requirements can generally be satisfied easily, at the cost
of some wasted space, by ensuring that the allocator always returns a
pointer that meets all alignment restrictions. The alloc of Chapter 5
does not guarantee any particular alignment, so we will use the
standard library function malloc, which does.  In Chapter 8 we will
show one way to implement malloc.

The question of the type declaration for a function like malloc is a
vexing one for any language that takes its type-checking seriously.
In C, the proper method is to declare that malloc returns a pointer to
void, then explicitly coerce the pointer into the desired type with a
cast.  malloc and related routines are declared in the standard header
<stdlib.h>.  Thus talloc can be written as

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

/* talloc:  make a tnode */
struct tnode *talloc(void)
{
    return (struct tnode *) malloc(sizeof(struct tnode));
}
```

strdup merely copies the string given by its argument into a safe
place, obtained by a call on malloc:

```c
char *strdup(char *s)   /* make a duplicate of s */
{
    char *p;

    p = (char *) malloc(strlen(s)+1); /* +1 for '\0' */
    if (p != NULL)
        strcpy(p, s);
    return p;
}
```

malloc returns NULL if no space is available; strdup passes that value
on, leaving error- handling to its caller.

Storage obtained by calling malloc may be freed for re-use by calling
free; see Chapters 8 and 7.

**Exercise 6-2**. Write a program that reads a C program and prints in
alphabetical order each group of variable names that are identical in
the first 6 characters, but different somewhere thereafter. Don't
count words within strings and comments. Make 6 a parameter that can
be set from the command line.

**Exercise 6-3**.  Write a cross-referencer that prints a list of all
words in a document, and for each word, a list of the line numbers on
which it occurs.  Remove noise words like "the," "and," and so on.

**Exercise 6-4**. Write a program that prints the distinct words in
its input sorted into decreasing order of frequency of
occurrence. Precede each word by its count.

# 6.6 Table Lookup

In this section we will write the innards of a table-lookup package,
to illustrate more aspects of structures.  This code is typical of
what might be found in the symbol table management routines of a macro
processor or a compiler.  For example, consider the #define statement.
When a line like

```c
#define  IN  1
```

is encountered, the name IN and the replacement text 1 are stored in a
table. Later, when the name IN appears in a statement like

```c
state = IN;
```

it must be replaced by 1.

There are two routines that manipulate the names and replacement
texts.  install(s,t) records the name s and the replacement text t in
a table; s and t are just character strings.  lookup(s) searches for s
in the table, and returns a pointer to the place where it was found,
or NULL if it wasn't there.

The algorithm is a hash-search - the incoming name is converted into a
small non-negative integer, which is then used to index into an array
of pointers. An array element points to the beginning of a linked list
of blocks describing names that have that hash value. It is NULL if no
names have hashed to that value.

TODO Picture.

A block in the list is a structure containing pointers to the name,
the replacement text, and the next block in the list. A null
next-pointer marks the end of the list.

```c
struct nlist {       /* table entry: */
    struct nlist *next;   /* next entry in chain */
    char *name;           /* defined name */
    char *defn;           /* replacement text */
};
```

The pointer array is just

```c
#define HASHSIZE 101

static struct nlist *hashtab[HASHSIZE];  /* pointer table */
```

The hashing function, which is used by both lookup and install, adds
each character value in the string to a scrambled combination of the
previous ones and returns the remainder modulo the array size. This is
not the best possible hash function, but it is short and effective.

```c
/* hash:  form hash value for string s */
unsigned hash(char *s)
{
    unsigned hashval;

    for (hashval = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
        hashval = *s + 31 * hashval;

    return hashval % HASHSIZE;
}
```

Unsigned arithmetic ensures that the hash value is non-negative.

The hashing process produces a starting index in the array hashtab; if
the string is to be found anywhere, it will be in the list of blocks
beginning there. The search is performed by lookup. If lookup finds
the entry already present, it returns a pointer to it; if not, it
returns NULL.

```c
/* lookup:  look for s in hashtab */
struct nlist *lookup(char *s)
{
    struct nlist *np;

    for (np = hashtab[hash(s)];  np != NULL; np = np->next)
        if (strcmp(s, np->name) == 0)
            return np;     /* found */
    return NULL;           /* not found */
}
```

The for loop in lookup is the standard idiom for walking along a
linked list:

```c
for (ptr = head; ptr != NULL; ptr = ptr->next)
    ...
```

install uses lookup to determine whether the name being installed is
already present; if so, the new definition will supersede the old one.
Otherwise, a new entry is created.  install returns NULL if for any
reason there is no room for a new entry.

```c
struct nlist *lookup(char *);
char *strdup(char *);

/* install:  put (name, defn) in hashtab */
struct nlist *install(char *name, char *defn)
{
    struct nlist *np;
    unsigned hashval;

    if ((np = lookup(name)) == NULL) { /* not found */
        np = (struct nlist *) malloc(sizeof(*np));
        if (np == NULL || (np->name = strdup(name)) == NULL)
            return NULL;
        hashval = hash(name);
        np->next = hashtab[hashval];
        hashtab[hashval] = np;
    } else       /* already there */
        free((void *) np->defn);   /*free previous defn */
    if ((np->defn = strdup(defn)) == NULL)
        return NULL;
    return np;
}
```

**Exercise 6-5**. Write a function undef that will remove a name and
definition from the table maintained by lookup and install.

**Exercise 6-6**. Implement a simple version of the #define processor
(i.e., no arguments) suitable for use with C programs, based on the
routines of this section.  You may also find getch and ungetch
helpful.

# 6.7 Typedef

C provides a facility called typedef for creating new data type names.
For example, the declaration

```c
typedef int Length;
```

makes the name Length a synonym for int.  The type Length can be used
in declarations, casts, etc., in exactly the same ways that the int
type can be:

```c
Length len, maxlen;
Length *lengths[];
```

Similarly, the declaration

```c
typedef char *String;
```

makes String a synonym for char * or character pointer, which may then
be used in declarations and casts:

```c
String p, lineptr[MAXLINES], alloc(int);
int strcmp(String, String);
p = (String) malloc(100);
```

Notice that the type being declared in a typedef appears in the
position of a variable name, not right after the word
typedef. Syntactically, typedef is like the storage classes extern,
static, etc. We have used capitalized names for typedefs, to make them
stand out.

As a more complicated example, we could make typedefs for the tree
nodes shown earlier in this chapter:

```c
typedef struct tnode *Treeptr;

typedef struct tnode { /* the tree node: */
    char *word;           /* points to the text */
    int count;            /* number of occurrences */
    struct tnode *left;   /* left child */
    struct tnode *right;  /* right child */
} Treenode;
```

This creates two new type keywords called Treenode (a structure) and
Treeptr (a pointer to the structure). Then the routine talloc could
become

```c
Treeptr talloc(void)
{
    return (Treeptr) malloc(sizeof(Treenode));
}
```

It must be emphasized that a typedef declaration does not create a new
type in any sense; it merely adds a new name for some existing
type. Nor are there any new semantics: variables declared this way
have exactly the same properties as variables whose declarations are
spelled out explicitly.  In effect, typedef is like #define, except
that since it is interpreted by the compiler, it can cope with textual
substitutions that are beyond the capabilities of the
preprocessor. For example,

```c
typedef int (*PFI)(char *, char *);
```

creates the type PFI, for "pointer to function (of two char *
arguments) returning int," which can be used in contexts like

```c
PFI strcmp, numcmp;
```

in the sort program of Chapter 5.

Besides purely aesthetic issues, there are two main reasons for using
typedefs. The first is to parameterize a program against portability
problems. If typedefs are used for data types that may be
machine-dependent, only the typedefs need change when the program is
moved. One common situation is to use typedef names for various
integer quantities, then make an appropriate set of choices of short,
int, and long for each host machine. Types like size_t and ptrdiff_t
from the standard library are examples.

The second purpose of typedefs is to provide better documentation for
a program - a type called Treeptr may be easier to understand than one
declared only as a pointer to a complicated structure.

# 6.8 Unions

A union is a variable that may hold (at different times) objects of
different types and sizes, with the compiler keeping track of size and
alignment requirements. Unions provide a way to manipulate different
kinds of data in a single area of storage, without embedding any
machine-dependent information in the program.  They are analogous to
variant records in pascal.

As an example such as might be found in a compiler symbol table
manager, suppose that a constant may be an int, a float, or a
character pointer.  The value of a particular constant must be stored
in a variable of the proper type, yet it is most convenient for table
management if the value occupies the same amount of storage and is
stored in the same place regardless of its type. This is the purpose
of a union - a single variable that can legitimately hold any of one
of several types. The syntax is based on structures:

```c
union u_tag {
    int ival;
    float fval;
    char *sval;
} u;
```

The variable u will be large enough to hold the largest of the three
types; the specific size is implementation-dependent.  Any of these
types may be assigned to u and then used in expressions, so long as
the usage is consistent: the type retrieved must be the type most
recently stored. It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track
of which type is currently stored in a union; the results are
implementation-dependent if something is stored as one type and
extracted as another.

Syntactically, members of a union are accessed as

```
union-name.member
```

or

```
union-pointer->member
```

just as for structures. If the variable utype is used to keep track of
the current type stored in u, then one might see code such as

```c
if (utype == INT)
    printf("%d\n", u.ival);
if (utype == FLOAT)
    printf("%f\n", u.fval);
if (utype == STRING)
    printf("%s\n", u.sval);
else
    printf("bad type %d in utype\n", utype);
```

Unions may occur within structures and arrays, and vice versa. The
notation for accessing a member of a union in a structure (or vice
versa) is identical to that for nested structures. For example, in the
structure array defined by

```c
struct {
    char *name;
    int flags;
    int utype;
    union {
        int ival;
        float fval;
        char *sval;
    } u;
} symtab[NSYM];
```

the member ival is referred to as

```c
symtab[i].u.ival
```

and the first character of the string sval by either of

```c
*symtab[i].u.sval
symtab[i].u.sval[0]
```

In effect, a union is a structure in which all members have offset
zero from the base, the structure is big enough to hold the "widest"
member, and the alignment is appropriate for all of the types in the
union.  The same operations are permitted on unions as on structures:
assignment to or copying as a unit, taking the address, and accessing
a member.

A union may only be initialized with a value of the type of its first
member; thus union u described above can only be initialized with an
integer value.

The storage allocator in Chapter 8 shows how a union can be used to
force a variable to be aligned on a particular kind of storage
boundary.

# 6.9 Bit-fields

When storage space is at a premium, it may be necessary to pack
several objects into a single machine word; one common use is a set of
single-bit flags in applications like compiler symbol
tables. Externally-imposed data formats, such as interfaces to
hardware devices, also often require the ability to get at pieces of a
word.

Imagine a fragment of a compiler that manipulates a symbol table.
Each identifier in a program has certain information associated with
it, for example, whether or not it is a keyword, whether or not it is
external and/or static, and so on.  The most compact way to encode
such information is a set of one-bit flags in a single char or int.

The usual way this is done is to define a set of "masks" corresponding
to the relevant bit positions, as in

```c
#define KEYWORD  01
#define EXTRENAL 02
#define STATIC   04
```

or

```c
enum { KEYWORD = 01, EXTERNAL = 02, STATIC = 04 };
```

The numbers must be powers of two.  Then accessing the bits becomes a
matter of "bit- fiddling" with the shifting, masking, and
complementing operators that were described in Chapter 2.

Certain idioms appear frequently:

```c
flags |= EXTERNAL | STATIC;
```

turns on the EXTERNAL and STATIC bits in flags, while

```c
flags &= ~(EXTERNAL | STATIC);
```

turns them off, and

```c
if ((flags & (EXTERNAL | STATIC)) == 0) ...
```

is true if both bits are off.

Although these idioms are readily mastered, as an alternative C offers
the capability of defining and accessing fields within a word directly
rather than by bitwise logical operators.  A bit-field, or field for
short, is a set of adjacent bits within a single
implementation-defined storage unit that we will call a "word." For
example, the symbol table #defines above could be replaced by the
definition of three fields:

```c
struct {
    unsigned int is_keyword : 1;
    unsigned int is_extern  : 1;
    unsigned int is_static  : 1;
} flags;
```

This defines a variable table called flags that contains three 1-bit
fields.  The number following the colon represents the field width in
bits. The fields are declared unsigned int to ensure that they are
unsigned quantities.

Individual fields are referenced the same way as other structure
members: flags.is_keyword, flags.is_extern, etc.  Fields behave like
small integers, and may participate in arithmetic expressions just
like other integers. Thus the previous examples may be written more
naturally as

```c
flags.is_extern = flags.is_static = 1;
```

to turn the bits on;

```c
flags.is_extern = flags.is_static = 0;
```

to turn them off; and

```c
if (flags.is_extern == 0 && flags.is_static == 0)
    ...
```

to test them.

Almost everything about fields is implementation-dependent. Whether a
field may overlap a word boundary is implementation-defined. Fields
need not be names; unnamed fields (a colon and width only) are used
for padding. The special width 0 may be used to force alignment at the
next word boundary.

Fields are assigned left to right on some machines and right to left
on others. This means that although fields are useful for maintaining
internally-defined data structures, the question of which end comes
first has to be carefully considered when picking apart
externally-defined data; programs that depend on such things are not
portable. Fields may be declared only as ints; for portability,
specify signed or unsigned explicitly. They are not arrays and they do
not have addresses, so the & operator cannot be applied on them.
