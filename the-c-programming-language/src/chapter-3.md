title: Chapter 3
subtitle: Control Flow
---

The control-flow of a language specify the order in which computations
are performed. We have already met the most common control-flow
constructions in earlier examples; here we will complete the set, and
be more precise about the ones discussed before.

# 3.1 Statements and Blocks

An expression such as x = 0 or i++ or printf(...)  becomes a statement
when it is followed by a semicolon, as in

```c
x = 0;
i++;
printf(...);
```

In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator
as it is in languages like Pascal.

Braces { and } are used to group declarations and statements together
into a compound statement, or block, so that they are syntactically
equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround the
statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around
multiple statements after an if, else, while, or for are
another. (Variables can be declared inside any block; we will talk
about this in Chapter 4.) There is no semicolon after the right brace
that ends a block.

# 3.2 If-Else

The if-else statement is used to express decisions.
Formally the syntax is

```c
if (expression)
    statement1
else
    statement2
```

where the else part is optional. The expression is evaluated; if it is
true (that is, if expression has a non-zero value), statement1 is
executed. If it is false (expression is zero) and if there is an else
part, statement2 is executed instead.

Since an if tests the numeric value of an expression, certain coding
shortcuts are possible.  The most obvious is writing

```c
if (expression)
```

instead of

```c
if (expression != 0)
```

Sometimes this is natural and clear; at other times it can be cryptic.

Because the else part of an if-else is optional,there is an ambiguity
when an else if omitted from a nested if sequence. This is resolved by
associating the else with the closest previous else-less if. For
example, in

```c
if (n > 0)
    if (a > b)
        z = a;
    else
        z = b;
```

the else goes to the inner if, as we have shown by indentation. If
that isn't what you want, braces must be used to force the proper
association:

```c
if (n > 0) {
    if (a > b)
         z = a;
}
else
    z = b;
```

The ambiguity is especially pernicious in situations like this:

```c
if (n > 0)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (s[i] > 0) {
            printf("...");
            return i;
        }
else        /* WRONG */
    printf("error -- n is negative\n");
```

The indentation shows unequivocally what you want, but the compiler
doesn't get the message, and associates the else with the inner
if. This kind of bug can be hard to find; it's a good idea to use
braces when there are nested ifs.

By the way, notice that there is a semicolon after z = a in

```c
if (a > b)
    z = a;
else
    z = b;
```

This is because grammatically, a statement follows the if, and an
expression statement like "z = a;" is always terminated by a
semicolon.

# 3.3 Else-If

The construction

```c
if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else
    statement
```

occurs so often that it is worth a brief separate discussion. This
sequence of if statements is the most general way of writing a
multi-way decision. The expressions are evaluated in order; if an
expression is true, the statement associated with it is executed, and
this terminates the whole chain. As always, the code for each
statement is either a single statement, or a group of them in braces.

The last else part handles the "none of the above" or default case
where none of the other conditions is satisfied. Sometimes there is no
explicit action for the default; in that case the trailing

```c
else
    statement
```

can be omitted, or it may be used for error checking to catch an
"impossible" condition.

To illustrate a three-way decision, here is a binary search function
that decides if a particular value x occurs in the sorted array v.
The elements of v must be in increasing order.  The function returns
the position (a number between 0 and n-1) if x occurs in v, and -1 if
not.

Binary search first compares the input value x to the middle element
of the array v. If x is less than the middle value, searching focuses
on the lower half of the table, otherwise on the upper half. In either
case, the next step is to compare x to the middle element of the
selected half.  This process of dividing the range in two continues
until the value is found or the range is empty.

```c
/* binsearch:  find x in v[0] <= v[1] <= ... <= v[n-1] */
int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)
{
    int low, high, mid;

    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low+high)/2;
        if (x < v[mid])
            high = mid + 1;
        else if (x  > v[mid])
            low = mid + 1;
        else    /* found match */
            return mid;
    }
    return -1;   /* no match */
}
```

The fundamental decision is whether x is less than, greater than, or
equal to the middle element v[mid] at each step; this is a natural for
else-if.

**Exercise 3-1**. Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when
one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside.)  Write a
version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference
in run-time.

# 3.4 Switch

The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an
expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and
branches accordingly.

```c
switch (expression) {
    case const-expr: statements
    case const-expr: statements
    default: statements
}
```

Each case is labeled by one or more integer-valued constants or
constant expressions. If a case matches the expression value,
execution starts at that case.  All case expressions must be
different.  The case labeled default is executed if none of the other
cases are satisfied.  A default is optional; if it isn't there and if
none of the cases match, no action at all takes place.  Cases and the
default clause can occur in any order.

In Chapter 1 we wrote a program to count the occurrences of each
digit, white space, and all other characters, using a sequence of if
... else if ... else. Here is the same program with a switch:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()  /* count digits, white space, others */
{
    int c, i, nwhite, nother, ndigit[10];

    nwhite = nother = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        ndigit[i] = 0;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        switch (c) {
        case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4':
        case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9':
            ndigit[c-'0']++;
            break;
        case ' ':
        case '\n':
        case '\t':
            nwhite++;
            break;
        default:
            nother++;
            break;
        }
    }
    printf("digits =");
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
    printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n",
        nwhite, nother);
    return 0;
}
```

The break statement causes an immediate exit from the switch. Because
cases serve just as labels, after the code for one case is done,
execution falls through to the next unless you take explicit action to
escape. break and return are the most common ways to leave a switch. A
break statement can also be used to force an immediate exit from
while, for, and do loops, as will be discussed later in this chapter.

Falling through cases is a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it
allows several cases to be attached to a single action, as with the
digits in this example. But it also implies that normally each case
must end with a break to prevent falling through to the next. Falling
through from one case to another is not robust, being prone to
disintegration when the program is modified.  With the exception of
multiple labels for a single computation, fall-throughs should be used
sparingly, and commented.

As a matter of good form, put a break after the last case (the default
here) even though it's logically unnecessary.  Some day when another
case gets added at the end, this bit of defensive programming will
save you.

**Exercise 3-2**.  Write a function escape(s,t) that converts
characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like \n
and \t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch. Write a function
for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the
real characters.

# 3.5 Loops - While and For

We have already encountered the while and for loops. In

```c
while (expression)
    statement
```

the expression is evaluated.  If it is non-zero, statement is executed
and expression is re- evaluated.  This cycle continues until
expression becomes zero, at which point execution resumes after
statement.

The for statement

```c
for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
    statement
```

is equivalent to

```c
expr1;
while (expr2) {
    statement
    expr3;
}
```

except for the behaviour of continue, which is described in Section 3.7.

Grammatically, the three components of a for loop are
expressions. Most commonly, expr1 and expr3 are assignments or
function calls and expr2 is a relational expression.  Any of the three
parts can be omitted, although the semicolons must remain. If expr1 or
expr3 is omitted, it is simply dropped from the expansion.  If the
test, expr2, is not present, it is taken as permanently true, so

```c
for (;;) {
    ...
}
```

is an "infinite" loop, presumably to be broken by other means, such as
a break or return.

Whether to use while or for is largely a matter of personal
preference. For example, in

```c
while ((c = getchar()) == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
    ;   /* skip white space characters */
```

there is no initialization or re-initialization,
so the while is most natural.

The for is preferable when there is a simple initialization and
increment since it keeps the loop control statements close together
and visible at the top of the loop. This is most obvious in

```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    ...
```

which is the C idiom for processing the first n elements of an array,
the analog of the Fortran DO loop or the Pascal for. The analogy is
not perfect, however, since the index variable i retains its value
when the loop terminates for any reason. Because the components of the
for are arbitrary expressions, for loops are not restricted to
arithmetic progressions. Nonetheless, it is bad style to force
unrelated computations into the initialization and increment of a for,
which are better reserved for loop control operations.

As a larger example, here is another version of atoi for converting a
string to its numeric equivalent. This one is slightly more general
than the one in Chapter 2; it copes with optional leading white space
and an optional + or - sign. (Chapter 4 shows atof, which does the
same conversion for floating-point numbers.)

The structure of the program reflects the form of the input:

```
skip white space, if any
get sign, if any
get integer part and convert it
```

Each step does its part, and leaves things in a clean state for the
next.  The whole process terminates on the first character that could
not be part of a number.

```c
#include <ctype.h>

/* atoi:  convert s to integer; version 2 */
int atoi(char s[])
{
    int i, n, sign;

    for (i = 0; isspace(s[i]); i++)  /* skip white space */
        ;
    sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
    if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-')  /* skip sign */
        i++;
    for (n = 0; isdigit(s[i]); i++)
        n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0');
    return sign * n;
}
```

The standard library provides a more elaborate function strtol for
conversion of strings to long integers; see Section 5 of Appendix B.

The advantages of keeping loop control centralized are even more
obvious when there are several nested loops.  The following function
is a Shell sort for sorting an array of integers.  The basic idea of
this sorting algorithm, which was invented in 1959 by D. L. Shell, is
that in early stages, far-apart elements are compared, rather than
adjacent ones as in simpler interchange sorts.  This tends to
eliminate large amounts of disorder quickly, so later stages have less
work to do. The interval between compared elements is gradually
decreased to one, at which point the sort effectively becomes an
adjacent interchange method.

```c
/* shellsort:  sort v[0]...v[n-1] into increasing order */
void shellsort(int v[], int n)
{
    int gap, i, j, temp;

    for (gap = n/2; gap > 0; gap /= 2)
        for (i = gap; i < n; i++)
            for (j=i-gap; j>=0 && v[j]>v[j+gap]; j-=gap) {
                temp = v[j];
                v[j] = v[j+gap];
                v[j+gap] = temp;
            }
}
```

There are three nested loops.  The outermost controls the gap between
compared elements, shrinking it from n/2 by a factor of two each pass
until it becomes zero.  The middle loop steps along the elements. The
innermost loop compares each pair of elements that is separated by gap
and reverses any that are out of order.  Since gap is eventually
reduced to one, all elements are eventually ordered correctly.  Notice
how the generality of the for makes the outer loop fit in the same
form as the others, even though it is not an arithmetic progression.

One final C operator is the comma ",", which most often finds use in
the for statement. A pair of expressions separated by a comma is
evaluated left to right, and the type and value of the result are the
type and value of the right operand. Thus in a for statement, it is
possible to place multiple expressions in the various parts, for
example to process two indices in parallel.  This is illustrated in
the function reverse(s), which reverses the string s in place.

```c
#include <string.h>

/* reverse:  reverse string s in place */
void reverse(char s[])
{
    int c, i, j;

    for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i < j; i++, j--) {
        c = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = c;
    }
}
```

The commas that separate function arguments, variables in
declarations, etc., are not comma operators, and do not guarantee left
to right evaluation.

Comma operators should be used sparingly. The most suitable uses are
for constructs strongly related to each other, as in the for loop in
reverse, and in macros where a multistep computation has to be a
single expression. A comma expression might also be appropriate for
the exchange of elements in reverse, where the exchange can be thought
of a single operation:

```c
for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i < j; i++, j--)
       c = s[i], s[i] = s[j], s[j] = c;
```

**Exercise 3-3**. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands
shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent
complete list abc...xyz in s2.  Allow for letters of either case and
digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and
-a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.

# 3.6 Loops - Do-While

As we discussed in Chapter 1, the while and for loops test the
termination condition at the top. By contrast, the third loop in C,
the do-while, tests at the bottom after making each pass through the
loop body; the body is always executed at least once.

The syntax of the do is

```c
do
    statement
while (expression);
```

The statement is executed, then expression is evaluated.  If it is
true, statement is evaluated again, and so on.  When the expression
becomes false, the loop terminates.  Except for the sense of the test,
do-while is equivalent to the Pascal repeat-until statement.

Experience shows that do-while is much less used than while and
for. Nonetheless, from time to time it is valuable, as in the
following function itoa, which converts a number to a character string
(the inverse of atoi).  The job is slightly more complicated than
might be thought at first, because the easy methods of generating the
digits generate them in the wrong order. We have chosen to generate
the string backwards, then reverse it.

```c
/* itoa:  convert n to characters in s */
void itoa(int n, char s[])
{
    int i, sign;

    if ((sign = n) < 0)  /* record sign */
        n = -n;          /* make n positive */
    i = 0;
    do {      /* generate digits in reverse order */
        s[i++] = n % 10 + '0';  /* get next digit */
    } while ((n /= 10) > 0);    /* delete it */
    if (sign < 0)
        s[i++] = '-';
    s[i] = '\0';
    reverse(s);
}
```

The do-while is necessary, or at least convenient, since at least one
character must be installed in the array s, even if n is zero. We also
used braces around the single statement that makes up the body of the
do-while, even though they are unnecessary, so the hasty reader will
not mistake the while part for the beginning of a while loop.

**Exercise 3-4**. In a two's complement number representation, our
version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number, that is,
the value of n equal to -(2wordsize-1). Explain why not. Modify it to
print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it
runs.

**Exercise 3-5**. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the
integer n into a base b character representation in the string s.  In
particular, itob(n,s,16) formats s as a hexadecimal integer in s.

**Exercise 3-6**. Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments
instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width; the
converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary
to make it wide enough.

# 3.7 Break and Continue

It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than
by testing at the top or bottom.  The break statement provides an
early exit from for, while, and do, just as from switch. A break
causes the innermost enclosing loop or switch to be exited
immediately.

The following function, trim, removes trailing blanks, tabs and
newlines from the end of a string, using a break to exit from a loop
when the rightmost non-blank, non-tab, non-newline is found.

```c
/* trim:  remove trailing blanks, tabs, newlines */
int trim(char s[])
{
    int n;

    for (n = strlen(s)-1; n >= 0; n--)
        if (s[n] != ' ' && s[n] != '\t' && s[n] != '\n')
            break;
    s[n+1] = '\0';
    return n;
}
```

strlen returns the length of the string. The for loop starts at the
end and scans backwards looking for the first character that is not a
blank or tab or newline. The loop is broken when one is found, or when
n becomes negative (that is, when the entire string has been scanned).
You should verify that this is correct behavior even when the string
is empty or contains only white space characters.

The continue statement is related to break, but less often used; it
causes the next iteration of the enclosing for, while, or do loop to
begin. In the while and do, this means that the test part is executed
immediately; in the for, control passes to the increment step. The
continue statement applies only to loops, not to switch.  A continue
inside a switch inside a loop causes the next loop iteration.

As an example, this fragment processes only the non-negative elements
in the array a; negative values are skipped.

```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (a[i] < 0)   /* skip negative elements */
        continue;
    ... /* do positive elements */
```

The continue statement is often used when the part of the loop that
follows is complicated, so that reversing a test and indenting another
level would nest the program too deeply.

# 3.8 Goto and labels

C provides the infinitely-abusable goto statement, and labels to
branch to. Formally, the goto statement is never necessary, and in
practice it is almost always easy to write code without it.  We have
not used goto in this book.

Nevertheless, there are a few situations where gotos may find a
place. The most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested
structure, such as breaking out of two or more loops at once.  The
break statement cannot be used directly since it only exits from the
innermost loop. Thus:

```
    for ( ... )
        for ( ... ) {
            ...
            if (disaster)
                goto error;
        }
    ...
error:
    /* clean up the mess */
```

This organization is handy if the error-handling code is non-trivial,
and if errors can occur in several places.

A label has the same form as a variable name, and is followed by a
colon. It can be attached to any statement in the same function as the
goto. The scope of a label is the entire function.

As another example, consider the problem of determining whether two
arrays a and b have an element in common. One possibility is

```c
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++)
            if (a[i] == b[j])
                goto found;
    /* didn't find any common element */
    ...
found:
    /* got one: a[i] == b[j] */
    ...
```

Code involving a goto can always be written without one, though
perhaps at the price of some repeated tests or an extra variable. For
example, the array search becomes

```c
found = 0;
for (i = 0; i < n && !found; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < m && !found; j++)
        if (a[i] == b[j])
            found = 1;
if (found)
    /* got one: a[i-1] == b[j-1] */
    ...
else
    /* didn't find any common element */
    ...
```

With a few exceptions like those cited here, code that relies on goto
statements is generally harder to understand and to maintain than code
without gotos. Although we are not dogmatic about the matter, it does
seem that goto statements should be used rarely, if at all.
