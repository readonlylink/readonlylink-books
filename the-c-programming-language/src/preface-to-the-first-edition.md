title: Preface to the first edition

C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of
expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of
operators.  C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big"
one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But
its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient
and effective for many
tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating
system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the
C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including
all of the software used to prepare this book) are written in
C. Production compilers also exist for several other machines,
including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell 6000, and the Interdata
8/32.  C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however,
and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any
machine that supports C.

This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C.  It
contains a tutorial introduction to get new users started as soon as
possible, separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference
manual.  Most of the treatment is based on reading, writing and
revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the
most part, the examples are complete, real programs rather than
isolated fragments.  All examples have been tested directly from the
text, which is in machine-readable form.  Besides showing how to make
effective use of the language, we have also tried where possible to
illustrate useful algorithms
and principles of good style and sound design.

The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some
familiarity with basic programming concepts loops, and functions.
like variables, assignment statements, Nonetheless, a novice
programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language,
although access to more knowledgeable colleague will help.

In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive and
versatile language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to
learn, and it wears well as on's experience with it grows. We
hope that this book will help you to use it well.

The thoughtful criticisms and suggestions of many friends and
colleagues have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in
writing it.  In particular, Mike Bianchi, Jim Blue, Stu Feldman, Doug
McIlroy Bill Roome, Bob Rosin and Larry Rosler all read multiple
volumes with care. We are also indebted to Al Aho, Steve Bourne, Dan
Dvorak, Chuck Haley, Debbie Haley, Marion Harris, Rick Holt, Steve
Johnson, John Mashey, Bob Mitze, Ralph Muha, Peter Nelson, Elliot
Pinson, Bill Plauger, Jerry Spivack, Ken Thompson, and Peter
Weinberger for helpful comments at various stages, and to Mile Lesk
and Joe Ossanna for
invaluable assistance with typesetting.
