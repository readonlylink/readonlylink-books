subtitle: Pointers and Arrays
---

A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a
variable. Pointers are much used in C, partly because they are
sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because
they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be
obtained in other ways.  Pointers and arrays are closely related; this
chapter also explores this relationship and shows how to exploit it.

Pointers have been lumped with the goto statement as a marvelous way
to create impossible- to-understand programs. This is certainly true
when they are used carelessly, and it is easy to create pointers that
point somewhere unexpected. With discipline, however, pointers can
also be used to achieve clarity and simplicity. This is the aspect
that we will try to illustrate.

The main change in ANSI C is to make explicit the rules about how
pointers can be manipulated, in effect mandating what good programmers
already practice and good compilers already enforce. In addition, the
type void * (pointer to void) replaces char * as the proper type for a
generic pointer.

# 5.1 Pointers and Addresses

Let us begin with a simplified picture of how memory is organized. A
typical machine has an array of consecutively numbered or addressed
memory cells that may be manipulated individually or in contiguous
groups. One common situation is that any byte can be a char, a pair of
one-byte cells can be treated as a short integer, and four adjacent
bytes form a long.  A pointer is a group of cells (often two or four)
that can hold an address. So if c is a char and p is a pointer that
points to it, we could represent the situation this way:

TODO ASCII art or picture needed here.

The unary operator & gives the address of an object, so the statement

```c
p = &c;
```

assigns the address of c to the variable p, and p is said to "point
to" c. The & operator only applies to objects in memory: variables and
array elements.  It cannot be applied to expressions, constants, or
register variables.

The unary operator * is the indirection or dereferencing operator;
when applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the pointer points
to. Suppose that x and y are integers and ip is a pointer to int. This
artificial sequence shows how to declare a pointer and how to use &
and *:

```c
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip;          /* ip is a pointer to int */

ip = &x;          /* ip now points to x */
y = *ip;          /* y is now 1 */
*ip = 0;          /* x is now 0 */
ip = &z[0];       /* ip now points to z[0] */
```

The declaration of x, y, and z are what we've seen all along. The
declaration of the pointer ip,

```c
int *ip;
```

is intended as a mnemonic; it says that the expression *ip is an int.
The syntax of the declaration for a variable mimics the syntax of
expressions in which the variable might appear. This reasoning applies
to function declarations as well. For example,

```c
double *dp, atof(char *);
```

says that in an expression *dp and atof(s) have values of double, and
that the argument of atof is a pointer to char.

You should also note the implication that a pointer is constrained to
point to a particular kind of object: every pointer points to a
specific data type. (There is one exception: a "pointer to void" is
used to hold any type of pointer but cannot be dereferenced
itself. We'll come back to it in Section 5.11.)

If ip points to the integer x, then *ip can occur in any context where
x could, so

```c
*ip = *ip + 10;
```

increments *ip by 10.

The unary operators * and & bind more tightly than arithmetic
operators, so the assignment

```c
y = *ip + 1
```

takes whatever ip points at, adds 1, and assigns the result to y,
while

```c
*ip += 1
```

increments what ip points to, as do

```c
++*ip
```

and

```c
(*ip)++
```

The parentheses are necessary in this last example; without them, the
expression would increment ip instead of what it points to, because
unary operators like * and ++ associate right to left.

Finally, since pointers are variables, they can be used without
dereferencing. For example, if iq is another pointer to int,

```c
iq = ip
```

copies the contents of ip into iq, thus making iq point to whatever ip
pointed to.

# 5.2 Pointers and Function Arguments

Since C passes arguments to functions by value, there is no direct way
for the called function to alter a variable in the calling
function. For instance, a sorting routine might exchange two
out-of-order arguments with a function called swap. It is not enough
to write

```c
swap(a, b);
```

where the swap function is defined as

```c
void swap(int x, int y)  /* WRONG */
{
    int temp;

    temp = x;
    x = y;
    y = temp;
}
```

Because of call by value, swap can't affect the arguments a and b in
the routine that called it.  The function above swaps copies of a and
b.

The way to obtain the desired effect is for the calling program to
pass pointers to the values to be changed:

```c
swap(&a, &b);
```

Since the operator & produces the address of a variable, &a is a
pointer to a. In swap itself, the parameters are declared as pointers,
and the operands are accessed indirectly through them.

```c
void swap(int *px, int *py)  /* interchange *px and *py */
{
    int temp;

    temp = *px;
    *px = *py;
    *py = temp;
}
```

Pictorially:

TODO picture.

Pointer arguments enable a function to access and change objects in
the function that called it.  As an example, consider a function
getint that performs free-format input conversion by breaking a stream
of characters into integer values, one integer per call. getint has to
return the value it found and also signal end of file when there is no
more input. These values have to be passed back by separate paths, for
no matter what value is used for EOF, that could also be the value of
an input integer.

One solution is to have getint return the end of file status as its
function value, while using a pointer argument to store the converted
integer back in the calling function.  This is the scheme used by
scanf as well; see Section 7.4.

The following loop fills an array with integers by calls to getint:

```c
int n, array[SIZE], getint(int *);

for (n = 0; n < SIZE && getint(&array[n]) != EOF; n++)
    ;
```

Each call sets array[n] to the next integer found in the input and
increments n. Notice that it is essential to pass the address of
array[n] to getint. Otherwise there is no way for getint to
communicate the converted integer back to the caller.

Our version of getint returns EOF for end of file, zero if the next
input is not a number, and a positive value if the input contains a
valid number.

```c
#include <ctype.h>

int getch(void);
void ungetch(int);

/* getint:  get next integer from input into *pn */
int getint(int *pn)
{
    int c, sign;

    while (isspace(c = getch()))   /* skip white space */
        ;
    if (!isdigit(c) && c != EOF && c != '+' && c != '-') {
        ungetch(c);  /* it is not a number */
        return 0;
    }
    sign = (c == '-') ? -1 : 1;
    if (c == '+' || c == '-')
        c = getch();
    for (*pn = 0; isdigit(c), c = getch())
        *pn = 10 * *pn + (c - '0');
    *pn *= sign;
    if (c != EOF)
        ungetch(c);
    return c;
}
```

Throughout getint, *pn is used as an ordinary int variable. We have
also used getch and ungetch (described in Section 4.3) so the one
extra character that must be read can be pushed back onto the input.

**Exercise 5-1**. As written, getint treats a + or - not followed by a
digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to push such a
character back on the input.

**Exercise 5-2**. Write getfloat, the floating-point analog of getint.
What type does getfloat return as its function value?

# 5.3 Pointers and Arrays

In C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays,
strong enough that pointers and arrays should be discussed
simultaneously. Any operation that can be achieved by array
subscripting can also be done with pointers. The pointer version will
in general be faster but, at least to the uninitiated, somewhat harder
to understand.

The declaration

```c
int a[10];
```

defines an array of size 10, that is, a block of 10 consecutive
objects named a[0], a[1], ..., a[9].

TODO Picture.

The notation a[i] refers to the i-th element of the array.  If pa is a
pointer to an integer, declared as

```c
int *pa;
```

then the assignment

```c
pa = &a[0];
```

sets pa to point to element zero of a; that is, pa contains the
address of a[0].

TODO Picture.

Now the assignment

```c
x = *pa;
```

will copy the contents of a[0] into x.

If pa points to a particular element of an array, then by definition
pa+1 points to the next element, pa+i points i elements after pa, and
pa-i points i elements before.  Thus, if pa points to a[0],

```c
*(pa+1)
```

refers to the contents of a[1], pa+i is the address of a[i], and
*(pa+i) is the contents of a[i].

TODO Picture.

These remarks are true regardless of the type or size of the variables
in the array a.  The meaning of "adding 1 to a pointer," and by
extension, all pointer arithmetic, is that pa+1 points to the next
object, and pa+i points to the i-th object beyond pa.

The correspondence between indexing and pointer arithmetic is very
close. By definition, the value of a variable or expression of type
array is the address of element zero of the array.  Thus after the
assignment

```c
pa = &a[0];
```

pa and a have identical values. Since the name of an array is a
synonym for the location of the initial element, the assignment
pa=&a[0] can also be written as

```c
pa = a;
```

Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference
to a[i] can also be written as `*(a+i)`.  In evaluating a[i], C converts
it to `*(a+i)` immediately; the two forms are equivalent.  Applying the
operator & to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that &a[i]
and a+i are also identical: a+i is the address of the i-th element
beyond a. As the other side of this coin, if pa is a pointer,
expressions might use it with a subscript; pa[i] is identical to
`*(pa+i)`. In short, an array-and-index expression is equivalent to one
written as a pointer and offset.

There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must
be kept in mind.  A pointer is a variable, so pa=a and pa++ are legal.
But an array name is not a variable; constructions like a=pa and a++
are illegal.

When an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the
location of the initial element. Within the called function, this
argument is a local variable, and so an array name parameter is a
pointer, that is, a variable containing an address. We can use this
fact to write another version of strlen, which computes the length of
a string.

```c
/* strlen:  return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
    int n;

    for (n = 0; *s != '\0', s++)
        n++;
    return n;
}
```

Since s is a pointer, incrementing it is perfectly legal; s++ has no
effect on the character string in the function that called strlen, but
merely increments strlen's private copy of the pointer. That means
that calls like

```c
strlen("hello, world");   /* string constant */
strlen(array);            /* char array[100]; */
strlen(ptr);              /* char *ptr; */
```

all work.

As formal parameters in a function definition,

```c
char s[];
```

and

```c
char *s;
```

are equivalent; we prefer the latter because it says more explicitly
that the variable is a pointer.  When an array name is passed to a
function, the function can at its convenience believe that it has been
handed either an array or a pointer, and manipulate it accordingly. It
can even use both notations if it seems appropriate and clear.

It is possible to pass part of an array to a function, by passing a
pointer to the beginning of the subarray. For example, if a is an
array,

```c
f(&a[2])
```

and

```c
f(a+2)
```

both pass to the function f the address of the subarray that starts at
a[2].  Within f, the parameter declaration can read

```c
f(int arr[]) { ... }
```

or

```c
f(int *arr) { ... }
```

So as far as f is concerned, the fact that the parameter refers to
part of a larger array is of no consequence.

If one is sure that the elements exist, it is also possible to index
backwards in an array; p[-1], p[-2], and so on are syntactically
legal, and refer to the elements that immediately precede p[0]. Of
course, it is illegal to refer to objects that are not within the
array bounds.

# 5.4 Address Arithmetic

If p is a pointer to some element of an array, then p++ increments p
to point to the next element, and p+=i increments it to point i
elements beyond where it currently does.  These and similar
constructions are the simples forms of pointer or address arithmetic.

C is consistent and regular in its approach to address arithmetic; its
integration of pointers, arrays, and address arithmetic is one of the
strengths of the language.  Let us illustrate by writing a rudimentary
storage allocator. There are two routines. The first, alloc(n),
returns a pointer to n consecutive character positions, which can be
used by the caller of alloc for storing characters. The second,
afree(p), releases the storage thus acquired so it can be re- used
later.  The routines are "rudimentary" because the calls to afree must
be made in the opposite order to the calls made on alloc. That is, the
storage managed by alloc and afree is a stack, or last-in, first-out.
The standard library provides analogous functions called malloc and
free that have no such restrictions; in Section 8.7 we will show how
they can be implemented.

The easiest implementation is to have alloc hand out pieces of a large
character array that we will call allocbuf. This array is private to
alloc and afree. Since they deal in pointers, not array indices, no
other routine need know the name of the array, which can be declared
static in the source file containing alloc and afree, and thus be
invisible outside it.  In practical implementations, the array may
well not even have a name; it might instead be obtained by calling
malloc or by asking the operating system for a pointer to some unnamed
block of storage.

The other information needed is how much of allocbuf has been used.
We use a pointer, called allocp, that points to the next free
element. When alloc is asked for n characters, it checks to see if
there is enough room left in allocbuf. If so, alloc returns the
current value of allocp (i.e., the beginning of the free block), then
increments it by n to point to the next free area. If there is no
room, alloc returns zero.  afree(p) merely sets allocp to p if p is
inside allocbuf.

TODO Picture

```c
#define ALLOCSIZE 10000 /* size of available space */

static char allocbuf[ALLOCSIZE]; /* storage for alloc */
static char *allocp = allocbuf;  /* next free position */

char *alloc(int n)    /* return pointer to n characters */
{
    if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp >= n) {  /* it fits */
        allocp += n;
        return allocp - n; /* old p */
    } else      /* not enough room */
        return 0;
}

void afree(char *p)  /* free storage pointed to by p */
{
    if (p >= allocbuf && p < allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)
        allocp = p;
}
```

In general a pointer can be initialized just as any other variable
can, though normally the only meaningful values are zero or an
expression involving the address of previously defined data of
appropriate type. The declaration

```c
static char *allocp = allocbuf;
```

defines allocp to be a character pointer and initializes it to point
to the beginning of allocbuf, which is the next free position when the
program starts. This could also have been written

```c
static char *allocp = &allocbuf[0];
```

since the array name is the address of the zeroth element.

The test

```c
if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp >= n) {  /* it fits */
```

checks if there's enough room to satisfy a request for n
characters. If there is, the new value of allocp would be at most one
beyond the end of allocbuf.  If the request can be satisfied, alloc
returns a pointer to the beginning of a block of characters (notice
the declaration of the function itself). If not, alloc must return
some signal that there is no space left. C guarantees that zero is
never a valid address for data, so a return value of zero can be used
to signal an abnormal event, in this case no space.

Pointers and integers are not interchangeable.  Zero is the sole
exception: the constant zero may be assigned to a pointer, and a
pointer may be compared with the constant zero.  The symbolic constant
NULL is often used in place of zero, as a mnemonic to indicate more
clearly that this is a special value for a pointer.  NULL is defined
in <stdio.h>.  We will use NULL henceforth.

Tests like

```c
if (allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE - allocp >= n) {  /* it fits */
```

and

```c
if (p >= allocbuf && p < allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)
```

show several important facets of pointer arithmetic.  First, pointers
may be compared under certain circumstances. If p and q point to
members of the same array, then relations like ==, !=, <, >=, etc.,
work properly. For example,

```c
p < q
```

is true if p points to an earlier element of the array than q does.
Any pointer can be meaningfully compared for equality or inequality
with zero. But the behavior is undefined for arithmetic or comparisons
with pointers that do not point to members of the same array.  (There
is one exception: the address of the first element past the end of an
array can be used in pointer arithmetic.)

Second, we have already observed that a pointer and an integer may be
added or subtracted.  The construction

```c
p + n
```

means the address of the n-th object beyond the one p currently points
to.  This is true regardless of the kind of object p points to; n is
scaled according to the size of the objects p points to, which is
determined by the declaration of p. If an int is four bytes, for
example, the int will be scaled by four.

Pointer subtraction is also valid: if p and q point to elements of the
same array, and p<q, then q-p+1 is the number of elements from p to q
inclusive.  This fact can be used to write yet another version of
strlen:

```c
/* strlen:  return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
    char *p = s;

    while (*p != '\0')
        p++;
    return p - s;
}
```

In its declaration, p is initialized to s, that is, to point to the
first character of the string. In the while loop, each character in
turn is examined until the '\0' at the end is seen. Because p points
to characters, p++ advances p to the next character each time, and p-s
gives the number of characters advanced over, that is, the string
length. (The number of characters in the string could be too large to
store in an int. The header <stddef.h> defines a type `ptrdiff_t` that
is large enough to hold the signed difference of two pointer
values. If we were being cautious, however, we would use `size_t` for
the return value of strlen, to match the standard library
version. size_t is the unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof
operator.)

Pointer arithmetic is consistent: if we had been dealing with floats,
which occupy more storage that chars, and if p were a pointer to
float, p++ would advance to the next float.  Thus we could write
another version of alloc that maintains floats instead of chars,
merely by changing char to float throughout alloc and afree.  All the
pointer manipulations automatically take into account the size of the
objects pointed to.

The valid pointer operations are assignment of pointers of the same
type, adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer, subtracting or
comparing two pointers to members of the same array, and assigning or
comparing to zero. All other pointer arithmetic is illegal. It is not
legal to add two pointers, or to multiply or divide or shift or mask
them, or to add float or double to them, or even, except for void *,
to assign a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type without a
cast.

# 5.5 Character Pointers and Functions

A string constant, written as

```c
"I am a string"
```

is an array of characters. In the internal representation, the array
is terminated with the null character '\0' so that programs can find
the end. The length in storage is thus one more than the number of
characters between the double quotes.

Perhaps the most common occurrence of string constants is as arguments
to functions, as in

```c
printf("hello, world\n");
```

When a character string like this appears in a program, access to it
is through a character pointer; printf receives a pointer to the
beginning of the character array.  That is, a string constant is
accessed by a pointer to its first element.

String constants need not be function arguments. If pmessage is
declared as

```c
char *pmessage;
```

then the statement

```c
pmessage = "now is the time";
```

assigns to pmessage a pointer to the character array. This is not a
string copy; only pointers are involved. C does not provide any
operators for processing an entire string of characters as a unit.

There is an important difference between these definitions:

```c
char amessage[] = "now is the time"; /* an array */
char *pmessage = "now is the time"; /* a pointer */
```

amessage is an array, just big enough to hold the sequence of
characters and '\0' that initializes it. Individual characters within
the array may be changed but amessage will always refer to the same
storage. On the other hand, pmessage is a pointer, initialized to
point to a string constant; the pointer may subsequently be modified
to point elsewhere, but the result is undefined if you try to modify
the string contents.

TODO Picture.

We will illustrate more aspects of pointers and arrays by studying
versions of two useful functions adapted from the standard
library. The first function is strcpy(s,t), which copies the string t
to the string s. It would be nice just to say s=t but this copies the
pointer, not the characters. To copy the characters, we need a
loop. The array version first:

```c
/* strcpy:  copy t to s; array subscript version */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while ((s[i] = t[i]) != '\0')
        i++;
}
```

For contrast, here is a version of strcpy with pointers:

```c
/* strcpy:  copy t to s; pointer version */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while ((*s = *t) != '\0') {
        s++;
        t++;
    }
}
```

Because arguments are passed by value, strcpy can use the parameters s
and t in any way it pleases. Here they are conveniently initialized
pointers, which are marched along the arrays a character at a time,
until the '\0' that terminates t has been copied into s.

In practice, strcpy would not be written as we showed it
above. Experienced C programmers would prefer

```c
/* strcpy:  copy t to s; pointer version 2 */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    while ((*s++ = *t++) != '\0')
        ;
}
```

This moves the increment of s and t into the test part of the
loop. The value of *t++ is the character that t pointed to before t
was incremented; the postfix ++ doesn't change t until after this
character has been fetched. In the same way, the character is stored
into the old s position before s is incremented.  This character is
also the value that is compared against '\0' to control the loop.  The
net effect is that characters are copied from t to s, up and including
the terminating '\0'.

As the final abbreviation, observe that a comparison against '\0' is
redundant, since the question is merely whether the expression is
zero. So the function would likely be written as

```c
/* strcpy:  copy t to s; pointer version 3 */
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    while (*s++ = *t++)
        ;
}
```

Although this may seem cryptic at first sight, the notational
convenience is considerable, and the idiom should be mastered, because
you will see it frequently in C programs.

The strcpy in the standard library (<string.h>) returns the target
string as its function value.

The second routine that we will examine is strcmp(s,t), which compares
the character strings s and t, and returns negative, zero or positive
if s is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than t. The
value is obtained by subtracting the characters at the first position
where s and t disagree.

```c
/* strcmp:  return <0 if s<t, 0 if s==t, >0 if s>t */
int strcmp(char *s, char *t)
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; s[i] == t[i]; i++)
        if (s[i] == '\0')
            return 0;
    return s[i] - t[i];
}
```

The pointer version of strcmp:

```c
/* strcmp:  return <0 if s<t, 0 if s==t, >0 if s>t */
int strcmp(char *s, char *t)
{
    for ( ; *s == *t; s++, t++)
        if (*s == '\0')
            return 0;
    return *s - *t;
}
```

Since ++ and -- are either prefix or postfix operators, other
combinations of * and ++ and -- occur, although less frequently. For
example,

```c
*--p
```

decrements p before fetching the character that p points to. In fact,
the pair of expressions

```c
*p++ = val;  /* push val onto stack */
val = *--p;  /* pop top of stack into val */
```

are the standard idiom for pushing and popping a stack; see Section 4.3.

The header <string.h> contains declarations for the functions
mentioned in this section, plus a variety of other string-handling
functions from the standard library.

**Exercise 5-3**. Write a pointer version of the function strcat that
we showed in Chapter 2: strcat(s,t) copies the string t to the end of
s.

**Exercise 5-4**. Write the function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if
the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise.

**Exercise 5-5**. Write versions of the library functions strncpy,
strncat, and strncmp, which operate on at most the first n characters
of their argument strings.  For example, strncpy(s,t,n) copies at most
n characters of t to s. Full descriptions are in Appendix B.

**Exercise 5-6**. Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters
and exercises with pointers instead of array indexing. Good
possibilities include getline (Chapters 1 and 4), atoi, itoa, and
their variants (Chapters 2, 3, and 4), reverse (Chapter 3), and
strindex and getop (Chapter 4).

# 5.6 Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers

Since pointers are variables themselves, they can be stored in arrays
just as other variables can.  Let us illustrate by writing a program
that will sort a set of text lines into alphabetic order, a
stripped-down version of the UNIX program sort.

In Chapter 3, we presented a Shell sort function that would sort an
array of integers, and in Chapter 4 we improved on it with a
quicksort.  The same algorithms will work, except that now we have to
deal with lines of text, which are of different lengths, and which,
unlike integers, can't be compared or moved in a single operation. We
need a data representation that will cope efficiently and conveniently
with variable-length text lines.

This is where the array of pointers enters. If the lines to be sorted
are stored end-to-end in one long character array, then each line can
be accessed by a pointer to its first character.  The pointers
themselves can bee stored in an array. Two lines can be compared by
passing their pointers to strcmp.  When two out-of-order lines have to
be exchanged, the pointers in the pointer array are exchanged, not the
text lines themselves.

TODO Picture.

This eliminates the twin problems of complicated storage management
and high overhead that would go with moving the lines themselves.

The sorting process has three steps:

```
read all the lines of input
sort them
print them in order
```

As usual, it's best to divide the program into functions that match
this natural division, with the main routine controlling the other
functions. Let us defer the sorting step for a moment, and concentrate
on the data structure and the input and output.

The input routine has to collect and save the characters of each line,
and build an array of pointers to the lines.  It will also have to
count the number of input lines, since that information is needed for
sorting and printing. Since the input function can only cope with a
finite number of input lines, it can return some illegal count like -1
if too much input is presented.

The output routine only has to print the lines in the order in which
they appear in the array of pointers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXLINES 5000     /* max #lines to be sorted */

char *lineptr[MAXLINES];  /* pointers to text lines */

int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);

void qsort(char *lineptr[], int left, int right);

/* sort input lines */
main()
{
    int nlines;     /* number of input lines read */

    if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0) {
        qsort(lineptr, 0, nlines-1);
        writelines(lineptr, nlines);
        return 0;
    } else {
        printf("error: input too big to sort\n");
        return 1;
    }
}

#define MAXLEN 1000  /* max length of any input line */
int getline(char *, int);
char *alloc(int);

/* readlines:  read input lines */
int readlines(char *lineptr[], int maxlines)
{
    int len, nlines;
    char *p, line[MAXLEN];

    nlines = 0;
    while ((len = getline(line, MAXLEN)) > 0)
        if (nlines >= maxlines || p = alloc(len) == NULL)
            return -1;
        else {
            line[len-1] = '\0';  /* delete newline */
            strcpy(p, line);
            lineptr[nlines++] = p;
        }
    return nlines;
}

/* writelines:  write output lines */
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines)
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < nlines; i++)
        printf("%s\n", lineptr[i]);
}
```

The function getline is from Section 1.9.

The main new thing is the declaration for lineptr:

```c
char *lineptr[MAXLINES]
```

says that lineptr is an array of MAXLINES elements, each element of
which is a pointer to a char. That is, lineptr[i] is a character
pointer, and *lineptr[i] is the character it points to, the first
character of the i-th saved text line.

Since lineptr is itself the name of an array, it can be treated as a
pointer in the same manner as in our earlier examples, and writelines
can be written instead as

```c
/* writelines:  write output lines */
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines)
{
    while (nlines-- > 0)
        printf("%s\n", *lineptr++);
}
```

Initially, *lineptr points to the first line; each element advances it
to the next line pointer while nlines is counted down.

With input and output under control, we can proceed to sorting. The
quicksort from Chapter 4 needs minor changes: the declarations have to
be modified, and the comparison operation must be done by calling
strcmp.  The algorithm remains the same, which gives us some
confidence that it will still work.

```c
/* qsort:  sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */
void qsort(char *v[], int left, int right)
{
    int i, last;
    void swap(char *v[], int i, int j);

    if (left >= right)  /* do nothing if array contains */
        return;         /* fewer than two elements */
    swap(v, left, (left + right)/2);
    last = left;
    for (i = left+1; i <= right; i++)
        if (strcmp(v[i], v[left]) < 0)
            swap(v, ++last, i);
    swap(v, left, last);
    qsort(v, left, last-1);
    qsort(v, last+1, right);
}
```

Similarly, the swap routine needs only trivial changes:

```c
/* swap:  interchange v[i] and v[j] */
void swap(char *v[], int i, int j)
{
    char *temp;

    temp = v[i];
    v[i] = v[j];
    v[j] = temp;
}
```

Since any individual element of v (alias lineptr) is a character
pointer, temp must be also, so one can be copied to the other.

**Exercise 5-7**. Rewrite readlines to store lines in an array
supplied by main, rather than calling alloc to maintain storage. How
much faster is the program?

# 5.7 Multi-dimensional Arrays

C provides rectangular multi-dimensional arrays, although in practice
they are much less used than arrays of pointers. In this section, we
will show some of their properties.

Consider the problem of date conversion, from day of the month to day
of the year and vice versa.  For example, March 1 is the 60th day of a
non-leap year, and the 61st day of a leap year. Let us define two
functions to do the conversions: day_of_year converts the month and
day into the day of the year, and month_day converts the day of the
year into the month and day.  Since this latter function computes two
values, the month and day arguments will be pointers:

```c
month_day(1988, 60, &m, &d)
```

sets m to 2 and d to 29 (February 29th).

These functions both need the same information, a table of the number
of days in each month ("thirty days hath September ..."). Since the
number of days per month differs for leap years and non-leap years,
it's easier to separate them into two rows of a two-dimensional array
than to keep track of what happens to February during computation. The
array and the functions for performing the transformations are as
follows:

```c
static char daytab[2][13] = {
    {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
    {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}
};

/* day_of_year:  set day of year from month & day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day)
{
    int i, leap;
    leap = year%4 == 0 && year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0;
    for (i = 1; i < month; i++)
        day += daytab[leap][i];
    return day;
}

/* month_day:  set month, day from day of year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday)
{
    int i, leap;

    leap = year%4 == 0 && year%100 != 0 || year%400 == 0;
    for (i = 1; yearday > daytab[leap][i]; i++)
        yearday -= daytab[leap][i];
    *pmonth = i;
    *pday = yearday;
}
```

Recall that the arithmetic value of a logical expression, such as the
one for leap, is either zero (false) or one (true), so it can be used
as a subscript of the array daytab.

The array daytab has to be external to both day_of_year and month_day,
so they can both use it. We made it char to illustrate a legitimate
use of char for storing small non-character integers.

daytab is the first two-dimensional array we have dealt with. In C, a
two-dimensional array is really a one-dimensional array, each of whose
elements is an array.  Hence subscripts are written as

```c
daytab[i][j]    /* [row][col] */
```

rather than

```c
daytab[i,j]    /* WRONG */
```

Other than this notational distinction, a two-dimensional array can be
treated in much the same way as in other languages. Elements are
stored by rows, so the rightmost subscript, or column, varies fastest
as elements are accessed in storage order.

An array is initialized by a list of initializers in braces; each row
of a two-dimensional array is initialized by a corresponding
sub-list. We started the array daytab with a column of zero so that
month numbers can run from the natural 1 to 12 instead of 0
to 11. Since space is not at a premium here, this is clearer than
adjusting the indices.

If a two-dimensional array is to be passed to a function, the
parameter declaration in the function must include the number of
columns; the number of rows is irrelevant, since what is passed is, as
before, a pointer to an array of rows, where each row is an array of
13 ints. In this particular case, it is a pointer to objects that are
arrays of 13 ints.  Thus if the array daytab is to be passed to a
function f, the declaration of f would be:

```c
f(int daytab[2][13]) { ... }
```

It could also be

```c
f(int daytab[][13]) { ... }
```

since the number of rows is irrelevant, or it could be

```c
f(int (*daytab)[13]) { ... }
```

which says that the parameter is a pointer to an array of 13 integers.
The parentheses are necessary since brackets [] have higher precedence
than `*`.  Without parentheses, the declaration

```c
int *daytab[13]
```

is an array of 13 pointers to integers. More generally, only the first
dimension (subscript) of an array is free; all the others have to be
specified.

Section 5.12 has a further discussion of complicated declarations.

**Exercise 5-8**. There is no error checking in day_of_year or
month_day. Remedy this defect.

# 5.8 Initialization of Pointer Arrays

Consider the problem of writing a function `month_name(n)`, which
returns a pointer to a character string containing the name of the
n-th month.  This is an ideal application for an internal static
array. month_name contains a private array of character strings, and
returns a pointer to the proper one when called.  This section shows
how that array of names is initialized.

The syntax is similar to previous initializations:

```c
/* month_name:  return name of n-th month */
char *month_name(int n)
{
    static char *name[] = {
        "Illegal month",
        "January", "February", "March",
        "April", "May", "June",
        "July", "August", "September",
        "October", "November", "December"
    };

    return (n < 1 || n > 12) ? name[0] : name[n];
}
```

The declaration of name, which is an array of character pointers, is
the same as lineptr in the sorting example.  The initializer is a list
of character strings; each is assigned to the corresponding position
in the array. The characters of the i-th string are placed somewhere,
and a pointer to them is stored in name[i]. Since the size of the
array name is not specified, the compiler counts the initializers and
fills in the correct number.

# 5.9 Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays

Newcomers to C are sometimes confused about the difference between a
two-dimensional array and an array of pointers, such as name in the
example above. Given the definitions

```c
int a[10][20];
int *b[10];
```

then a[3][4] and b[3][4] are both syntactically legal references to a
single int. But a is a true two-dimensional array: 200 int-sized
locations have been set aside, and the conventional rectangular
subscript calculation 20 * row +col is used to find the element
a[row,col]. For b, however, the definition only allocates 10 pointers
and does not initialize them; initialization must be done explicitly,
either statically or with code. Assuming that each element of b does
point to a twenty-element array, then there will be 200 ints set
aside, plus ten cells for the pointers. The important advantage of the
pointer array is that the rows of the array may be of different
lengths. That is, each element of b need not point to a twenty-element
vector; some may point to two elements, some to fifty, and some to
none at all.

Although we have phrased this discussion in terms of integers, by far
the most frequent use of arrays of pointers is to store character
strings of diverse lengths, as in the function month_name. Compare the
declaration and picture for an array of pointers:

```c
char *name[] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };
```

TODO Picture.

with those for a two-dimensional array:

```c
char aname[][15] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };
```

TODO Picture.

**Exercise 5-9**.  Rewrite the routines day_of_year and month_day with
pointers instead of indexing.

# 5.10 Command-line Arguments

In environments that support C, there is a way to pass command-line
arguments or parameters to a program when it begins executing. When
main is called, it is called with two arguments.  The first
(conventionally called argc, for argument count) is the number of
command-line arguments the program was invoked with; the second (argv,
for argument vector) is a pointer to an array of character strings
that contain the arguments, one per string. We customarily use
multiple levels of pointers to manipulate these character strings.

The simplest illustration is the program echo, which echoes its
command-line arguments on a single line, separated by blanks. That is,
the command

```
echo hello, world
```

prints the output

```
hello, world
```

By convention, argv[0] is the name by which the program was invoked,
so argc is at least 1.  If argc is 1, there are no command-line
arguments after the program name. In the example above, argc is 3, and
argv[0], argv[1], and argv[2] are "echo", "hello,", and "world"
respectively.  The first optional argument is argv[1] and the last is
argv[argc-1]; additionally, the standard requires that argv[argc] be a
null pointer.

The first version of echo treats argv as an array of character
pointers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* echo command-line arguments; 1st version */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++)
        printf("%s%s", argv[i], (i < argc-1) ? " " : "");
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Since argv is a pointer to an array of pointers, we can manipulate the
pointer rather than index the array. This next variant is based on
incrementing argv, which is a pointer to pointer to char, while argc
is counted down:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* echo command-line arguments; 2nd version */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    while (--argc > 0)
        printf("%s%s", *++argv, (argc > 1) ? " " : "");
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Since argv is a pointer to the beginning of the array of argument
strings, incrementing it by 1 (++argv) makes it point at the original
argv[1] instead of argv[0].  Each successive increment moves it along
to the next argument; *argv is then the pointer to that argument. At
the same time, argc is decremented; when it becomes zero, there are no
arguments left to print.

Alternatively, we could write the printf statement as

```c
printf((argc > 1) ? "%s " : "%s", *++argv);
```

This shows that the format argument of printf can be an expression too.

As a second example, let us make some enhancements to the
pattern-finding program from Section 4.1.  If you recall, we wired the
search pattern deep into the program, an obviously unsatisfactory
arrangement. Following the lead of the UNIX program grep, let us
enhance the program so the pattern to be matched is specified by the
first argument on the command line.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXLINE 1000

int getline(char *line, int max);

/* find:  print lines that match pattern from 1st arg */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    int found = 0;

    if (argc != 2)
        printf("Usage: find pattern\n");
    else
        while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
            if (strstr(line, argv[1]) != NULL) {
                printf("%s", line);
                found++;
            }
    return found;
}
```

The standard library function strstr(s,t) returns a pointer to the
first occurrence of the string t in the string s, or NULL if there is
none. It is declared in <string.h>.

The model can now be elaborated to illustrate further pointer
constructions. Suppose we want to allow two optional arguments.  One
says "print all the lines except those that match the pattern;" the
second says "precede each printed line by its line number."

A common convention for C programs on UNIX systems is that an argument
that begins with a minus sign introduces an optional flag or
parameter.  If we choose -x (for "except") to signal the inversion,
and -n ("number") to request line numbering, then the command

```
find -x -npattern
```

will print each line that doesn't match the pattern, preceded by its
line number.

Optional arguments should be permitted in any order, and the rest of
the program should be independent of the number of arguments that we
present.  Furthermore, it is convenient for users if option arguments
can be combined, as in

```
find -nx pattern
```

Here is the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAXLINE 1000

int getline(char *line, int max);

/* find: print lines that match pattern from 1st arg */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINE];
    long lineno = 0;
    int c, except = 0, number = 0, found = 0;

    while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-')
        while (c = *++argv[0])
            switch (c) {
            case 'x':
                except = 1;
                break;
            case 'n':
                number = 1;
                break;
            default:
                printf("find: illegal option %c\n", c);
                argc = 0;
                found = -1;
                break;
            }
    if (argc != 1)
        printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");
    else
        while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0) {
            lineno++;
            if ((strstr(line, *argv) != NULL) != except) {
                if (number)
                    printf("%ld:", lineno);
                printf("%s", line);
                found++;
            }
        }
    return found;
}
```

argc is decremented and argv is incremented before each optional
argument. At the end of the loop, if there are no errors, argc tells
how many arguments remain unprocessed and argv points to the first of
these.  Thus argc should be 1 and *argv should point at the pattern.
Notice that *++argv is a pointer to an argument string, so
(*++argv)[0] is its first character.  (An alternate valid form would
be **++argv.)  Because [] binds tighter than * and ++, the parentheses
are necessary; without them the expression would be taken as
*++(argv[0]). In fact, that is what we have used in the inner loop,
where the task is to walk along a specific argument string.  In the
inner loop, the expression *++argv[0] increments the pointer argv[0]!

It is rare that one uses pointer expressions more complicated than
these; in such cases, breaking them into two or three steps will be
more intuitive.

**Exercise 5-10**. Write the program expr, which evaluates a reverse
Polish expression from the command line, where each operator or
operand is a separate argument. For example,

```
expr 2 3 4 + *
```

evaluates 2 * (3+4).

**Exercise 5-11**. Modify the program entab and detab (written as
exercises in Chapter 1) to accept a list of tab stops as
arguments. Use the default tab settings if there are no arguments.

**Exercise 5-12**. Extend entab and detab to accept the shorthand

```
entab -m +n
```

to mean tab stops every n columns, starting at column m.  Choose
convenient (for the user) default behavior.


**Exercise 5-13**. Write the program tail, which prints the last n
lines of its input. By default, n is set to 10, let us say, but it can
be changed by an optional argument so that

```
tail -n
```

prints the last n lines. The program should behave rationally no
matter how unreasonable the input or the value of n. Write the program
so it makes the best use of available storage; lines should be stored
as in the sorting program of Section 5.6, not in a two-dimensional
array of fixed size.

# 5.11 Pointers to Functions

In C, a function itself is not a variable, but it is possible to
define pointers to functions, which can be assigned, placed in arrays,
passed to functions, returned by functions, and so on. We will
illustrate this by modifying the sorting procedure written earlier in
this chapter so that if the optional argument -n is given, it will
sort the input lines numerically instead of lexicographically.

A sort often consists of three parts - a comparison that determines
the ordering of any pair of objects, an exchange that reverses their
order, and a sorting algorithm that makes comparisons and exchanges
until the objects are in order.  The sorting algorithm is independent
of the comparison and exchange operations, so by passing different
comparison and exchange functions to it, we can arrange to sort by
different criteria. This is the approach taken in our new sort.

Lexicographic comparison of two lines is done by strcmp, as before; we
will also need a routine numcmp that compares two lines on the basis
of numeric value and returns the same kind of condition indication as
strcmp does. These functions are declared ahead of main and a pointer
to the appropriate one is passed to qsort. We have skimped on error
processing for arguments, so as to concentrate on the main issues.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXLINES 5000     /* max #lines to be sorted */
char *lineptr[MAXLINES];  /* pointers to text lines */

int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);
void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);

void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right,
           int (*comp)(void *, void *));
int numcmp(char *, char *);

/* sort input lines */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int nlines;        /* number of input lines read */
    int numeric = 0;   /* 1 if numeric sort */

    if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "-n") == 0)
        numeric = 1;
    if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0) {
        qsort((void**) lineptr, 0, nlines-1,
          (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));
        writelines(lineptr, nlines);
        return 0;
    } else {
        printf("input too big to sort\n");
        return 1;
    }
}
```

In the call to qsort, strcmp and numcmp are addresses of
functions. Since they are known to be functions, the & is not
necessary, in the same way that it is not needed before an array name.

We have written qsort so it can process any data type, not just
character strings. As indicated by the function prototype, qsort
expects an array of pointers, two integers, and a function with two
pointer arguments.  The generic pointer type void * is used for the
pointer arguments. Any pointer can be cast to void * and back again
without loss of information, so we can call qsort by casting arguments
to void *.  The elaborate cast of the function argument casts the
arguments of the comparison function. These will generally have no
effect on actual representation, but assure the compiler that all is
well.

```c
/* qsort:  sort v[left]...v[right] into increasing order */
void qsort(void *v[], int left, int right,
           int (*comp)(void *, void *))
{
    int i, last;

    void swap(void *v[], int, int);

    if (left >= right)    /* do  nothing if array contains */
        return;           /* fewer than two elements */
    swap(v, left, (left + right)/2);
    last = left;
    for (i = left+1; i <= right;  i++)
        if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) < 0)
            swap(v, ++last, i);
    swap(v, left, last);
    qsort(v, left, last-1, comp);
    qsort(v, last+1, right, comp);
}
```

The declarations should be studied with some care. The fourth
parameter of qsort is

```c
int (*comp)(void *, void *)
```

which says that comp is a pointer to a function that has two void *
arguments and returns an int.

The use of comp in the line

```c
if ((*comp)(v[i], v[left]) < 0)
```

is consistent with the declaration: comp is a pointer to a function,
*comp is the function, and

```c
(*comp)(v[i], v[left])
```

is the call to it.  The parentheses are needed so the components are
correctly associated; without them,

```c
int *comp(void *, void *)    /* WRONG */
```

says that comp is a function returning a pointer to an int, which is
very different.

We have already shown strcmp, which compares two strings.  Here is
numcmp, which compares two strings on a leading numeric value,
computed by calling atof:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

/* numcmp:  compare s1 and s2 numerically */
int numcmp(char *s1, char *s2)
{
    double v1, v2;

    v1 = atof(s1);
    v2 = atof(s2);
    if (v1 < v2)
        return -1;
    else if (v1 > v2)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}
```

The swap function, which exchanges two pointers, is identical to what
we presented earlier in the chapter, except that the declarations are
changed to void `*`.

```c
void swap(void *v[],  int i, int j;)
{
    void *temp;

    temp = v[i];
    v[i] = v[j];
    v[j] = temp;
}
```

A variety of other options can be added to the sorting program; some
make challenging exercises.

**Exercise 5-14**. Modify the sort program to handle a -r flag, which
indicates sorting in reverse (decreasing) order. Be sure that -r works
with -n.

**Exercise 5-15**.  Add the option -f to fold upper and lower case
together, so that case distinctions are not made during sorting; for
example, a and A compare equal.

**Exercise 5-16**.  Add the -d ("directory order") option, which makes
comparisons only on letters, numbers and blanks. Make sure it works in
conjunction with -f.

**Exercise 5-17**.  Add a field-searching capability, so sorting may
bee done on fields within lines, each field sorted according to an
independent set of options. (The index for this book was sorted with
-df for the index category and -n for the page numbers.)

# 5.12 Complicated Declarations

C is sometimes castigated for the syntax of its declarations,
particularly ones that involve pointers to functions. The syntax is an
attempt to make the declaration and the use agree; it works well for
simple cases, but it can be confusing for the harder ones, because
declarations cannot be read left to right, and because parentheses are
over-used. The difference between

```c
int *f();       /* f: function returning pointer to int */
```

and

```c
int (*pf)();    /* pf: pointer to function returning int */
```

illustrates the problem: * is a prefix operator and it has lower
precedence than (), so parentheses are necessary to force the proper
association.

Although truly complicated declarations rarely arise in practice, it
is important to know how to understand them, and, if necessary, how to
create them.  One good way to synthesize declarations is in small
steps with typedef, which is discussed in Section 6.7.  As an
alternative, in this section we will present a pair of programs that
convert from valid C to a word description and back again. The word
description reads left to right.

The first, dcl, is the more complex. It converts a C declaration into
a word description, as in these examples:

```c
char **argv
    argv:  pointer to char
int (*daytab)[13]
    daytab:  pointer to array[13] of int
int *daytab[13]
    daytab:  array[13] of pointer to int
void *comp()
    comp: function returning pointer to void
void (*comp)()
    comp: pointer to function returning void
char (*(*x())[])()
    x: function returning pointer to array[] of
    pointer to function returning char
char (*(*x[3])())[5]
    x: array[3] of pointer to function returning
    pointer to array[5] of char
```

`dcl` is based on the grammar that specifies a declarator, which is
spelled out precisely in Appendix A, Section 8.5; this is a simplified
form:

```
dcl:          optional *'s direct-dcl
direct-dcl:   name
              (dcl)
              direct-dcl()
              direct-dcl[optional size]
```

In words, a dcl is a direct-dcl, perhaps preceded by *'s.  A
direct-dcl is a name, or a parenthesized dcl, or a direct-dcl followed
by parentheses, or a direct-dcl followed by brackets with an optional
size.

This grammar can be used to parse functions. For instance, consider
this declarator:

```c
(*pfa[])()
```

pfa will be identified as a name and thus as a direct-dcl. Then pfa[]
is also a direct-dcl. Then *pfa[] is recognized as a dcl, so (*pfa[])
is a direct-dcl. Then (*pfa[])() is a direct-dcl and thus a dcl. We
can also illustrate the parse with a tree like this (where direct-dcl
has been abbreviated to dir-dcl):

TODO Picture.

The heart of the dcl program is a pair of functions, dcl and dirdcl,
that parse a declaration according to this grammar.  Because the
grammar is recursively defined, the functions call each other
recursively as they recognize pieces of a declaration; the program is
called a recursive-descent parser.

```c
/* dcl:  parse a declarator */
void dcl(void)
{
    int ns;

    for (ns = 0; gettoken() == '*'; ) /* count *'s */
        ns++;
    dirdcl();
    while (ns-- > 0)
        strcat(out, " pointer to");
}

/* dirdcl:  parse a direct declarator */
void dirdcl(void)
{
    int type;

    if (tokentype == '(') {         /* ( dcl ) */
        dcl();
        if (tokentype != ')')
            printf("error: missing )\n");
    } else if (tokentype == NAME)  /* variable name */
        strcpy(name, token);
    else
        printf("error: expected name or (dcl)\n");
    while ((type=gettoken()) == PARENS || type == BRACKETS)
        if (type == PARENS)
            strcat(out, " function returning");
        else {
            strcat(out, " array");
            strcat(out, token);
            strcat(out, " of");
        }
}
```

Since the programs are intended to be illustrative, not bullet-proof,
there are significant restrictions on dcl. It can only handle a simple
data type line char or int. It does not handle argument types in
functions, or qualifiers like const. Spurious blanks confuse it. It
doesn't do much error recovery, so invalid declarations will also
confuse it. These improvements are left as exercises.

Here are the global variables and the main routine:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

#define MAXTOKEN  100

enum { NAME, PARENS, BRACKETS };

void dcl(void);
void dirdcl(void);

int gettoken(void);
int tokentype;           /* type of last token */
char token[MAXTOKEN];    /* last token string */
char name[MAXTOKEN];     /* identifier name */
char datatype[MAXTOKEN]; /* data type = char, int, etc. */
char out[1000];

main()  /* convert declaration to words */
{
    while (gettoken() != EOF) {   /* 1st token on line */
        strcpy(datatype, token);  /* is the datatype */
        out[0] = '\0';
        dcl();       /* parse rest of line */
        if (tokentype != '\n')
            printf("syntax error\n");
        printf("%s: %s %s\n", name, out, datatype);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The function gettoken skips blanks and tabs, then finds the next token
in the input; a "token" is a name, a pair of parentheses, a pair of
brackets perhaps including a number, or any other single character.

```c
int gettoken(void)  /* return next token */
{
    int c, getch(void);
    void ungetch(int);
    char *p = token;

    while ((c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\t')
        ;
    if (c == '(') {
        if ((c = getch()) == ')') {
            strcpy(token, "()");
            return tokentype = PARENS;
        } else {
            ungetch(c);
            return tokentype = '(';
        }
    } else if (c == '[') {
        for (*p++ = c; (*p++ = getch()) != ']'; )
            ;
        *p = '\0';
        return tokentype = BRACKETS;
    } else if (isalpha(c)) {
        for (*p++ = c; isalnum(c = getch()); )
            *p++ = c;
        *p = '\0';
        ungetch(c);
        return tokentype = NAME;
    } else
        return tokentype = c;
}
```

getch and ungetch are discussed in Chapter 4.

Going in the other direction is easier, especially if we do not worry
about generating redundant parentheses. The program undcl converts a
word description like "x is a function returning a pointer to an array
of pointers to functions returning char," which we will express as

```c
x () * [] * () char
```

to

```c
char (*(*x())[])()
```

The abbreviated input syntax lets us reuse the gettoken
function. undcl also uses the same external variables as dcl does.

```c
/* undcl:  convert word descriptions to declarations */
main()
{
    int type;
    char temp[MAXTOKEN];

    while (gettoken() != EOF) {
        strcpy(out, token);
        while ((type = gettoken()) != '\n')
            if (type == PARENS || type == BRACKETS)
                strcat(out, token);
            else if (type == '*') {
                sprintf(temp, "(*%s)", out);
                strcpy(out, temp);
            } else if (type == NAME) {
                sprintf(temp, "%s %s", token, out);
                strcpy(out, temp);
            } else
                printf("invalid input at %s\n", token);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Exercise 5-18**. Make dcl recover from input errors.

**Exercise 5-19**. Modify undcl so that it does not add redundant
parentheses to declarations.

**Exercise 5-20**. Expand dcl to handle declarations with function
argument types, qualifiers like const, and so on.
