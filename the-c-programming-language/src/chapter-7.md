title: Chapter 7
subtitle: Input and Output
---

Input and output are not part of the C language itself, so we have not emphasized them in our
presentation  thus  far.  Nonetheless,  programs  interact  with  their  environment  in  much  more
complicated  ways  than  those  we  have  shown  before.  In  this  chapter  we  will  describe  the
standard  library,  a  set  of  functions  that  provide  input  and  output,  string  handling,  storage
management, mathematical routines, and a variety of other services for C programs. We will
concentrate on input and output

The  ANSI  standard  defines  these  library  functions  precisely,  so  that  they  can  exist  in
compatible  form  on  any  system  where  C  exists.  Programs  that  confine  their  system
interactions  to  facilities  provided  by  the  standard  library  can  be  moved  from  one  system  to
another without change.

The  properties  of  library  functions  are  specified  in  more  than  a  dozen  headers;  we  have
already  seen  several  of  these,  including  <stdio.h>,  <string.h>,  and  <ctype.h>.  We  will
not present the entire library here, since we are more interested in writing C programs that use
it. The library is described in detail in Appendix B.

7.1 Standard Input and Output

As we said in Chapter 1, the library implements a simple model of text input and output. A
text  stream  consists  of  a  sequence  of  lines;  each  line  ends  with  a  newline  character.  If  the
system doesn't operate that way, the library does whatever necessary to make it appear as if it
does. For instance, the library might convert carriage return and linefeed to newline on input
and back again on output.

The  simplest  input  mechanism  is  to  read  one  character  at  a  time  from  the  standard  input,
normally the keyboard, with getchar:

   int getchar(void)
getchar returns the next input character each time it is called, or EOF when it encounters end
of  file.  The  symbolic  constant  EOF  is  defined  in  <stdio.h>.  The  value  is  typically  -1,  bus
tests should be written in terms of EOF so as to be independent of the specific value.

In many environments, a file may be substituted for the keyboard by using the < convention
for input redirection: if a program prog uses getchar, then the command line

   prog <infile
causes  prog  to  read  characters  from  infile  instead.  The  switching  of  the  input  is  done  in
such a way that prog itself is oblivious to the change; in particular, the string "<infile" is
not included in the command-line arguments in argv. Input switching is also invisible if the
input  comes  from  another  program  via  a  pipe  mechanism:  on  some  systems,  the  command
line

   otherprog | prog







runs the two programs otherprog and prog, and pipes the standard output of otherprog into
the standard input for prog.

136

The function

   int putchar(int)
is  used  for  output:  putchar(c)  puts  the  character  c  on  the  standard  output,  which  is  by
default  the  screen.  putchar  returns  the  character  written,  or  EOF  is  an  error  occurs.  Again,
output can usually be directed to a file with >filename: if prog uses putchar,

   prog >outfile
will write the standard output to outfile instead. If pipes are supported,

   prog | anotherprog
puts the standard output of prog into the standard input of anotherprog.

Output produced by  printf also finds its way to the standard output. Calls to putchar and
printf may be interleaved - output happens in the order in which the calls are made.

Each source file that refers to an input/output library function must contain the line

   #include <stdio.h>
before the first reference. When the name is bracketed by < and > a search is made for the
header in a standard set of places (for example, on UNIX systems, typically in the directory
/usr/include).

Many  programs  read  only  one  input  stream  and  write  only  one  output  stream;  for  such
programs,  input  and  output  with  getchar,  putchar,  and  printf  may  be  entirely  adequate,
and is certainly enough to get started. This is particularly true if redirection is used to connect
the output of one program to the input of the next. For example, consider the program lower,
which converts its input to lower case:

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <ctype.h>

   main() /* lower: convert input to lower case*/
   {
       int c

       while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
           putchar(tolower(c));
       return 0;
   }
The function tolower is defined in <ctype.h>; it converts an upper case letter to lower case,
and  returns  other  characters  untouched.  As  we  mentioned  earlier,  "functions"  like  getchar
and  putchar in  <stdio.h> and  tolower in  <ctype.h> are often macros, thus avoiding the
overhead  of  a  function  call  per  character.  We  will  show  how  this  is  done  in  Section  8.5.
Regardless of how the <ctype.h> functions are implemented on a given machine, programs
that use them are shielded from knowledge of the character set.

Exercise  7-1.  Write  a  program  that  converts  upper  case  to  lower  or  lower  case  to  upper,
depending on the name it is invoked with, as found in argv[0].

7.2 Formatted Output - printf

The  output  function  printf  translates  internal  values  to  characters.  We  have  used  printf
informally  in  previous  chapters.  The  description  here  covers  most  typical  uses  but  is  not
complete; for the full story, see Appendix B.

   int printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
printf converts, formats, and prints its arguments on the standard output under control of the
format. It returns the number of characters printed.

The format string contains two types of objects: ordinary characters, which are copied to the
output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which causes conversion and printing of
the next successive argument to printf. Each conversion specification begins with a % and
ends with a conversion character. Between the % and the conversion character there may be,
in order:

•  A minus sign, which specifies left adjustment of the converted argument.
•  A  number  that  specifies  the  minimum  field  width.  The  converted  argument  will  be
printed in a field at least this wide. If necessary it will be padded on the left (or right,
if left adjustment is called for) to make up the field width.
•  A period, which separates the field width from the precision.
•  A  number,  the  precision,  that  specifies  the  maximum  number  of  characters  to  be
printed from a string, or the number of digits after the decimal point of a floating-point
value, or the minimum number of digits for an integer.

•  An h if the integer is to be printed as a short, or l (letter ell) if as a long.

Conversion characters are shown in Table 7.1. If the character after the % is not a conversion
specification, the behavior is undefined.

6).

given by the precision (default 6).

double; use %e or %E if the exponent is less than -4 or greater than or equal to the
precision; otherwise use %f. Trailing zeros and a trailing decimal point are not
printed.

void *; pointer (implementation-dependent representation).




%

no argument is converted; print a %

A  width  or  precision  may  be  specified  as  *,  in  which  case  the  value  is  computed  by
converting  the  next  argument  (which  must  be  an  int).  For  example,  to  print  at  most  max
characters from a string s,

138

   printf("%.*s", max, s);
Most of the format conversions have been illustrated in earlier chapters. One exception is the
precision  as  it  relates  to  strings.  The  following  table  shows  the  effect  of  a  variety  of
specifications  in  printing  "hello,  world"  (12  characters).  We  have  put  colons  around  each
field so you can see it extent.

   :%s:          :hello, world:
   :%10s:        :hello, world:
   :%.10s:       :hello, wor:
   :%-10s:       :hello, world:
   :%.15s:       :hello, world:
   :%-15s:       :hello, world   :
   :%15.10s:     :     hello, wor:
   :%-15.10s:    :hello, wor     :
A  warning:  printf  uses  its  first  argument  to  decide  how  many  arguments  follow  and  what
their  type  is.  It  will  get  confused,  and  you  will  get  wrong  answers,  if  there  are  not  enough
arguments of if they are the wrong type. You should also be aware of the difference between
these two calls:

   printf(s);         /* FAILS if s contains % */
   printf("%s", s);   /* SAFE */
The function sprintf does the same conversions as printf does, but stores the output in a
string:

   int sprintf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
sprintf formats the arguments in arg1, arg2, etc., according to format as before, but places
the result in string instead of the standard output; string must be big enough to receive the
result.

Exercise  7-2.  Write  a  program  that  will  print  arbitrary  input  in  a  sensible  way.  As  a
minimum,  it  should  print  non-graphic  characters  in  octal  or  hexadecimal  according  to  local
custom, and break long text lines.

7.3 Variable-length Argument Lists

This  section  contains  an  implementation  of  a  minimal  version  of  printf,  to  show  how  to
write a function that processes a variable-length argument list in a portable way. Since we are
mainly interested in the argument processing,  minprintf will process the format string and
arguments but will call the real printf to do the format conversions.

The proper declaration for printf is

   int printf(char *fmt, ...)
where the declaration ... means that the number and types of these arguments may vary. The
declaration ... can only appear at the end of an argument list. Our minprintf is declared as









139

   void minprintf(char *fmt, ...)
since we will not return the character count that printf does.

The tricky bit is how minprintf walks along the argument list when the list doesn't even have
a name. The standard header <stdarg.h> contains a set of macro definitions that define how
to step through an argument list. The implementation of this header will vary from machine to
machine, but the interface it presents is uniform.

The  type  va_list  is  used  to  declare  a  variable  that  will  refer  to  each  argument  in  turn;  in
minprintf, this variable is called ap, for "argument pointer." The macro va_start initializes
ap  to  point  to  the  first  unnamed  argument.  It  must  be  called  once  before  ap  is  used.  There
must be at least one named argument; the final named argument is used by va_start to get
started.

Each call of va_arg returns one argument and steps ap to the next; va_arg uses a type name
to determine what type to return and how big a step to take. Finally, va_end does whatever
cleanup is necessary. It must be called before the program returns.

These properties form the basis of our simplified printf:

   #include <stdarg.h>

   /* minprintf: minimal printf with variable argument list */
   void minprintf(char *fmt, ...)
   {
       va_list ap; /* points to each unnamed arg in turn */
       char *p, *sval;
       int ival;
       double dval;

       va_start(ap, fmt); /* make ap point to 1st unnamed arg */
       for (p = fmt; *p; p++) {
           if (*p != '%') {
               putchar(*p);
               continue;
           }
           switch (*++p) {
           case 'd':
               ival = va_arg(ap, int);
               printf("%d", ival);
               break;
           case 'f':
               dval = va_arg(ap, double);
               printf("%f", dval);
               break;
           case 's':
               for (sval = va_arg(ap, char *); *sval; sval++)
                   putchar(*sval);
               break;
           default:
               putchar(*p);
               break;
           }
       }
       va_end(ap); /* clean up when done */
   }
Exercise 7-3. Revise minprintf to handle more of the other facilities of printf.

7.4 Formatted Input - Scanf

The  function  scanf  is  the  input  analog  of  printf,  providing  many  of  the  same  conversion
facilities in the opposite direction.

   int scanf(char *format, ...)
scanf reads characters from the standard input, interprets them according to the specification
in  format,  and  stores  the  results  through  the  remaining  arguments.  The  format  argument  is
described  below;  the  other  arguments,  each  of  which  must  be  a  pointer,  indicate  where  the
corresponding converted input should be stored. As with printf, this section is a summary of
the most useful features, not an exhaustive list.

scanf stops when it exhausts its format string, or when some input fails to match the control
specification.  It  returns  as  its  value  the  number  of  successfully  matched  and  assigned  input
items.  This  can  be  used  to  decide  how  many  items  were  found.  On  the  end  of  file,  EOF  is
returned; note that this is different from 0, which means that the next input character does not
match  the  first  specification  in  the  format  string.  The  next  call  to  scanf  resumes  searching
immediately after the last character already converted.

There is also a function sscanf that reads from a string instead of the standard input:

   int sscanf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...)
It scans the string according to the format in format and stores the resulting values through
arg1, arg2, etc. These arguments must be pointers.

The  format  string  usually  contains  conversion  specifications,  which  are  used  to  control
conversion of input. The format string may contain:

•  Blanks or tabs, which are not ignored.
•  Ordinary  characters  (not  %),  which  are  expected  to  match  the  next  non-white  space

character of the input stream.

•  Conversion  specifications,  consisting  of  the  character  %,  an  optional  assignment
suppression  character  *,  an  optional  number  specifying  a  maximum  field  width,  an
optional h, l or L indicating the width of the target, and a conversion character.

A conversion specification directs the conversion of the next input field. Normally the result
is places in the variable pointed to by the corresponding argument. If assignment suppression
is indicated by the * character, however, the input field is skipped; no assignment is made. An
input field is defined as a string of non-white space characters; it extends either to the next
white  space  character  or  until  the  field  width,  is  specified,  is  exhausted.  This  implies  that
scanf  will  read  across  boundaries  to  find  its  input,  since  newlines  are  white  space.  (White
space characters are blank, tab, newline, carriage return, vertical tab, and formfeed.)

The  conversion  character  indicates  the  interpretation  of  the  input  field.  The  corresponding
argument  must  be  a  pointer,  as  required  by  the  call-by-value  semantics  of  C.  Conversion
characters are shown in Table 7.2.

character string (not quoted); char *, pointing to an array of characters long
enough for the string and a terminating '\0' that will be added.
floating-point number with optional sign, optional decimal point and optional
exponent; float *
literal %; no assignment is made.

The conversion characters d, i, o, u, and x may be preceded by h to indicate that a pointer to
short rather than int appears in the argument list, or by l (letter ell) to indicate that a pointer
to long appears in the argument list.

As a first example, the rudimentary calculator of Chapter 4 can be written with scanf to do
the input conversion:

   #include <stdio.h>

   main()  /* rudimentary calculator */
   {
       double sum, v;

       sum = 0;
       while (scanf("%lf", &v) == 1)
           printf("\t%.2f\n", sum += v);
       return 0;
   }
Suppose we want to read input lines that contain dates of the form

   25 Dec 1988
The scanf statement is

   int day, year;
   char monthname[20];

   scanf("%d %s %d", &day, monthname, &year);
No & is used with monthname, since an array name is a pointer.

Literal characters can appear in the scanf format string; they must match the same characters
in the input. So we could read dates of the form mm/dd/yy with the scanf statement:

   int day, month, year;

   scanf("%d/%d/%d", &month, &day, &year);











142

scanf  ignores  blanks  and  tabs  in  its  format  string.  Furthermore,  it  skips  over  white  space
(blanks, tabs, newlines, etc.) as it looks for input values. To read input whose format is not
fixed,  it  is  often  best  to  read  a  line  at  a  time,  then  pick  it  apart  with  scanf.  For  example,
suppose we want to read lines that might contain a date in either of the forms above. Then we
could write

   while (getline(line, sizeof(line)) > 0) {
       if (sscanf(line, "%d %s %d", &day, monthname, &year) == 3)
           printf("valid: %s\n", line); /* 25 Dec 1988 form */
       else if (sscanf(line, "%d/%d/%d", &month, &day, &year) == 3)
           printf("valid: %s\n", line); /* mm/dd/yy form */
       else
           printf("invalid: %s\n", line); /* invalid form */
   }
Calls  to  scanf  can  be  mixed  with  calls  to  other  input  functions.  The  next  call  to  any  input
function will begin by reading the first character not read by scanf.

A  final  warning:  the  arguments  to  scanf  and  sscanf  must  be  pointers.  By  far  the  most
common error is writing

   scanf("%d", n);
instead of

   scanf("%d", &n);
This error is not generally detected at compile time.

Exercise  7-4.  Write  a  private  version  of  scanf  analogous  to  minprintf  from  the  previous
section.

Exercise 5-5. Rewrite the postfix calculator of Chapter 4 to use  scanf and/or sscanf to do
the input and number conversion.

7.5 File Access

The examples so far have all read the standard input and written the standard output, which
are automatically defined for a program by the local operating system.

The  next  step  is  to  write  a  program  that  accesses  a  file  that  is  not  already  connected  to  the
program. One program that illustrates the need for such operations is cat, which concatenates
a set of named files into the standard output. cat is used for printing files on the screen, and
as a general-purpose input collector for programs that do not have the capability of accessing
files by name. For example, the command

   cat x.c y.c
prints the contents of the files x.c and y.c (and nothing else) on the standard output.

The  question  is  how  to  arrange  for  the  named  files  to  be  read  -  that  is,  how  to  connect  the
external names that a user thinks of to the statements that read the data.

The rules are simple. Before it can be read or written, a file has to be opened by the library
function fopen. fopen takes an external name like x.c or y.c, does some housekeeping and







negotiation  with  the  operating  system  (details  of  which  needn't  concern  us),  and  returns  a
pointer to be used in subsequent reads or writes of the file.

This pointer, called the file pointer, points to a structure that contains information about the
file, such as the location of a buffer, the current character position in the buffer, whether the
file is being read or written, and whether errors or end of file have occurred. Users don't need
to  know  the  details,  because  the  definitions  obtained  from  <stdio.h>  include  a  structure
declaration called FILE. The only declaration needed for a file pointer is exemplified by

143

   FILE *fp;
   FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode);
This  says  that  fp  is  a  pointer  to  a  FILE, and  fopen returns a pointer to a  FILE. Notice that
FILE  is  a  type  name,  like  int,  not  a  structure  tag;  it  is  defined  with  a  typedef. (Details of
how fopen can be implemented on the UNIX system are given in Section 8.5.)

The call to fopen in a program is

   fp = fopen(name, mode);
The first argument of fopen is a character string containing the name of the file. The second
argument is the mode, also a character string, which indicates how one intends to use the file.
Allowable  modes  include  read  ("r"),  write  ("w"),  and  append  ("a").  Some  systems
distinguish between text and binary files; for the latter, a "b" must be appended to the mode
string.

If  a  file  that  does  not  exist  is  opened  for  writing  or  appending,  it  is  created  if  possible.
Opening an existing file for writing causes the old contents to be discarded, while opening for
appending preserves them. Trying to read a file that does not exist is an error, and there may
be other causes of error as well, like trying to read a file when you don't have permission. If
there is any error, fopen will return NULL. (The error can be identified more precisely; see the
discussion of error-handling functions at the end of Section 1 in Appendix B.)

The next thing needed is a way to read or write the file once it is open. getc returns the next
character from a file; it needs the file pointer to tell it which file.

   int getc(FILE *fp)
getc returns the next character from the stream referred to by fp; it returns EOF for end of file
or error.

putc is an output function:

   int putc(int c, FILE *fp)
putc writes the character c to the file fp and returns the character written, or EOF if an error
occurs. Like getchar and putchar, getc and putc may be macros instead of functions.

When  a  C  program  is  started,  the  operating  system  environment  is  responsible  for  opening
three  files  and  providing  pointers  for  them.  These  files  are  the  standard  input,  the  standard
output, and the standard error; the corresponding file pointers are called stdin, stdout, and
stderr,  and  are  declared  in  <stdio.h>.  Normally  stdin  is  connected  to  the  keyboard  and







stdout and stderr are connected to the screen, but stdin and stdout may be redirected to
files or pipes as described in Section 7.1.

getchar and putchar can be defined in terms of getc, putc, stdin, and stdout as follows:

144

   #define getchar()    getc(stdin)
   #define putchar(c)   putc((c), stdout)
For formatted input or output of files, the functions fscanf and fprintf may be used. These
are identical to scanf and printf, except that the first argument is a file pointer that specifies
the file to be read or written; the format string is the second argument.

   int fscanf(FILE *fp, char *format, ...)
   int fprintf(FILE *fp, char *format, ...)
With these preliminaries out of the way, we are now in a position to write the program cat to
concatenate  files.  The  design  is  one  that  has  been  found  convenient  for  many  programs.  If
there are command-line arguments, they are interpreted as filenames, and processed in order.
If there are no arguments, the standard input is processed.

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* cat:  concatenate files, version 1 */
   main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       FILE *fp;
       void filecopy(FILE *, FILE *)

       if (argc == 1) /* no args; copy standard input */
           filecopy(stdin, stdout);
       else
          while(--argc > 0)
              if ((fp = fopen(*++argv, "r")) == NULL) {
                  printf("cat: can't open %s\n, *argv);
                  return 1;
              } else {
                 filecopy(fp, stdout);
                 fclose(fp);
              }
          return 0;
   }

    /* filecopy:  copy file ifp to file ofp */
    void filecopy(FILE *ifp, FILE *ofp)
    {
        int c;

        while ((c = getc(ifp)) != EOF)
            putc(c, ofp);
    }
The file pointers stdin and stdout are objects of type FILE *. They are constants, however,
not variables, so it is not possible to assign to them.

The function

   int fclose(FILE *fp)
is  the  inverse  of  fopen,  it  breaks  the  connection  between  the  file  pointer  and  the  external
name  that  was  established  by  fopen,  freeing  the  file  pointer  for  another  file.  Since  most
operating  systems  have  some  limit  on  the  number  of  files  that  a  program  may  have  open











simultaneously, it's a good idea to free the file pointers when they are no longer needed, as we
did in cat. There is also another reason for fclose on an output file - it flushes the buffer in
which  putc  is  collecting  output.  fclose  is  called  automatically  for  each  open  file  when  a
program terminates normally. (You can close stdin and stdout if they are not needed. They
can also be reassigned by the library function freopen.)

7.6 Error Handling - Stderr and Exit

The  treatment  of  errors  in  cat  is  not  ideal.  The  trouble  is  that  if  one  of  the  files  can't  be
accessed for some reason, the diagnostic is printed at the end of the concatenated output. That
might be acceptable if the output is going to a screen, but not if it's going into a file or into
another program via a pipeline.

To  handle  this  situation  better,  a  second  output  stream,  called  stderr,  is  assigned  to  a
program  in  the  same  way  that  stdin  and  stdout  are.  Output  written  on  stderr  normally
appears on the screen even if the standard output is redirected.

Let us revise cat to write its error messages on the standard error.

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* cat:  concatenate files, version 2 */
   main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       FILE *fp;
       void filecopy(FILE *, FILE *);
       char *prog = argv[0];  /* program name for errors */

       if (argc == 1 ) /* no args; copy standard input */
           filecopy(stdin, stdout);
       else
           while (--argc > 0)
               if ((fp = fopen(*++argv, "r")) == NULL) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "%s: can't open %s\n",
                           prog, *argv);
                   exit(1);
               } else {
                   filecopy(fp, stdout);
                   fclose(fp);
               }
       if (ferror(stdout)) {
           fprintf(stderr, "%s: error writing stdout\n", prog);
           exit(2);
       }
       exit(0);
   }
The  program  signals  errors  in  two  ways.  First,  the  diagnostic  output  produced  by  fprintf
goes to  stderr, so it finds its way to the screen instead of disappearing down a pipeline or
into an output file. We included the program name, from argv[0], in the message, so if this
program is used with others, the source of an error is identified.

Second,  the  program  uses  the  standard  library  function  exit,  which  terminates  program
execution when it is called. The argument of exit is available to whatever process called this
one, so the success or failure of the program can be tested by another program that uses this
one  as  a  sub-process.  Conventionally,  a  return  value  of  0  signals  that  all  is  well;  non-zero






values  usually  signal  abnormal  situations.  exit  calls  fclose  for  each  open  output  file,  to
flush out any buffered output.

Within main, return expr is equivalent to exit(expr). exit has the advantage that it can be
called from other functions, and that calls to it can be found with a pattern-searching program
like those in Chapter 5.

The function ferror returns non-zero if an error occurred on the stream fp.

146

   int ferror(FILE *fp)
Although output errors are rare, they do occur (for example, if a disk fills up), so a production
program should check this as well.

The  function  feof(FILE  *)  is  analogous  to  ferror;  it  returns  non-zero  if  end  of  file  has
occurred on the specified file.

   int feof(FILE *fp)
We  have  generally  not  worried  about  exit  status  in  our  small  illustrative  programs,  but  any
serious program should take care to return sensible, useful status values.

7.7 Line Input and Output

The standard library provides an input and output routine fgets that is similar to the getline
function that we have used in earlier chapters:

   char *fgets(char *line, int maxline, FILE *fp)
fgets reads the next input line (including the newline) from file fp into the character array
line; at most maxline-1 characters will be read. The resulting line is terminated with '\0'.
Normally fgets returns line; on end of file or error it returns NULL. (Our getline returns the
line length, which is a more useful value; zero means end of file.)

For output, the function fputs writes a string (which need not contain a newline) to a file:

   int fputs(char *line, FILE *fp)
It returns EOF if an error occurs, and non-negative otherwise.

The library functions  gets and  puts are similar to  fgets and  fputs, but operate on  stdin
and stdout. Confusingly, gets deletes the terminating '\n', and puts adds it.

To  show  that  there  is  nothing  special  about  functions  like  fgets  and  fputs,  here  they  are,
copied from the standard library on our system:

   /* fgets:  get at most n chars from iop */
   char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *iop)
   {
       register int c;
       register char *cs;

       cs = s;
       while (--n > 0 && (c = getc(iop)) != EOF)









147

           if ((*cs++ = c) == '\n')
               break;
       *cs = '\0';
       return (c == EOF && cs == s) ? NULL : s;
   }

   /* fputs:  put string s on file iop */
   int fputs(char *s, FILE *iop)
   {
       int c;

       while (c = *s++)
           putc(c, iop);
       return ferror(iop) ? EOF : 0;
   }
For no obvious reason, the standard specifies different return values for ferror and fputs.

It is easy to implement our getline from fgets:

   /* getline:  read a line, return length */
   int getline(char *line, int max)
   {
       if (fgets(line, max, stdin) == NULL)
           return 0;
       else
           return strlen(line);
   }
Exercise 7-6. Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.

Exercise 7-7. Modify the pattern finding program of Chapter 5 to take its input from a set of
named files or, if no files are named as arguments, from the standard input. Should the file
name be printed when a matching line is found?

Exercise 7-8. Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page,
with a title and a running page count for each file.

7.8 Miscellaneous Functions

The standard library provides a wide variety of functions. This section is a brief synopsis of
the most useful. More details and many other functions can be found in Appendix B.

7.8.1 String Operations

We have already mentioned the string functions strlen, strcpy, strcat, and strcmp, found
in <string.h>. In the following, s and t are char *'s, and c and n are ints.
concatenate t to end of s

return negative, zero, or positive for s < t, s == t, s > t

strcat(s,t)
strncat(s,t,n)  concatenate n characters of t to end of s
strcmp(s,t)
strncmp(s,t,n)  same as strcmp but only in first n characters
strcpy(s,t)
strncpy(s,t,n)  copy at most n characters of t to s
strlen(s)
return length of s

copy t to s






148

strchr(s,c)

strrchr(s,c)

return pointer to first c in s, or NULL if not present

return pointer to last c in s, or NULL if not present

7.8.2 Character Class Testing and Conversion

Several functions from <ctype.h> perform character tests and conversions. In the following,
c is an int that can be represented as an unsigned char or EOF. The function returns int.

isalpha(c)  non-zero if c is alphabetic, 0 if not
isupper(c)  non-zero if c is upper case, 0 if not
islower(c)  non-zero if c is lower case, 0 if not
isdigit(c)  non-zero if c is digit, 0 if not
isalnum(c)  non-zero if isalpha(c) or isdigit(c), 0 if not
isspace(c)  non-zero if c is blank, tab, newline, return, formfeed, vertical tab
toupper(c)  return c converted to upper case
tolower(c)  return c converted to lower case

7.8.3 Ungetc

The  standard  library  provides  a  rather  restricted  version  of  the  function  ungetch  that  we
wrote in Chapter 4; it is called ungetc.

   int ungetc(int c, FILE *fp)
pushes the character  c back onto file  fp, and returns either  c, or  EOF for an error. Only one
character  of  pushback  is  guaranteed  per  file.  ungetc  may  be  used  with  any  of  the  input
functions like scanf, getc, or getchar.

7.8.4 Command Execution

The  function  system(char  *s)  executes  the  command  contained  in  the  character  string  s,
then resumes execution of the current program. The contents of s depend strongly on the local
operating system. As a trivial example, on UNIX systems, the statement

   system("date");
causes the program date to be run; it prints the date and time of day on the standard output.
system returns a system-dependent integer status from the command executed. In the UNIX
system, the status return is the value returned by exit.

7.8.5 Storage Management

The functions malloc and calloc obtain blocks of memory dynamically.

   void *malloc(size_t n)
returns a pointer to n bytes of uninitialized storage, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied.

   void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size)
returns a pointer to enough free space for an array of n objects of the specified size, or NULL if
the request cannot be satisfied. The storage is initialized to zero.







The pointer returned by malloc or calloc has the proper alignment for the object in question,
but it must be cast into the appropriate type, as in

149

   int *ip;

   ip = (int *) calloc(n, sizeof(int));
free(p) frees the space pointed to by p, where p was originally obtained by a call to malloc
or  calloc. There are no restrictions on the order in which space is freed, but it is a ghastly
error to free something not obtained by calling malloc or calloc.

It  is  also  an  error  to  use  something  after  it  has  been  freed.  A  typical  but  incorrect  piece  of
code is this loop that frees items from a list:

   for (p = head; p != NULL; p = p->next) /* WRONG */
       free(p);
The right way is to save whatever is needed before freeing:

   for (p = head; p != NULL; p = q) {
       q = p->next;
       free(p);
   }
Section 8.7 shows the implementation of a storage allocator like malloc, in which allocated
blocks may be freed in any order.

7.8.6 Mathematical Functions

There are more than twenty mathematical functions declared in <math.h>; here are some of
the more frequently used. Each takes one or two double arguments and returns a double.
sine of x, x in radians

cosine of x, x in radians

sin(x)
cos(x)
atan2(y,x)  arctangent of y/x, in radians
exp(x)
log(x)
log10(x)   common (base 10) logarithm of x (x>0)
pow(x,y)   xy
sqrt(x)
fabs(x)

exponential function ex
natural (base e) logarithm of x (x>0)

square root of x (x>0)

absolute value of x

7.8.7 Random Number generation

The function rand() computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range zero to
RAND_MAX, which is defined in <stdlib.h>. One way to produce random floating-point
numbers greater than or equal to zero but less than one is

   #define frand() ((double) rand() / (RAND_MAX+1.0))
(If your library already provides a function for floating-point random numbers, it is likely to
have better statistical properties than this one.)








The function srand(unsigned) sets the seed for rand. The portable implementation of rand
and srand suggested by the standard appears in Section 2.7.

Exercise  7-9.  Functions  like  isupper  can  be  implemented  to  save  space  or  to  save  time.
Explore both possibilities.
