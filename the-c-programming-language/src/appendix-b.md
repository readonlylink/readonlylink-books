title: Appendix B
subtitle: Standard Library
---

This appendix is a summary of the library defined by the ANSI standard. The standard library
is not part of the C language proper, but an environment that supports standard C will provide
the  function  declarations  and  type  and  macro  definitions  of  this  library.  We  have  omitted  a
few  functions  that  are  of  limited  utility  or  easily  synthesized  from  others;  we  have  omitted
multi-byte characters; and we have omitted discussion of locale issues; that is, properties that
depend on local language, nationality, or culture.

The functions, types and macros of the standard library are declared in standard headers:

   <assert.h>  <float.h>   <math.h>    <stdarg.h>  <stdlib.h>
   <ctype.h>   <limits.h>  <setjmp.h>  <stddef.h>  <string.h>
   <errno.h>   <locale.h>  <signal.h>  <stdio.h>   <time.h>
A header can be accessed by

  #include <header>

Headers may be included in any order and any number of times. A header must be included
outside of any external declaration or definition and before any use of anything it declares. A
header need not be a source file.

External identifiers that begin with an underscore are reserved for use by the library, as are all
other identifiers that begin with an underscore and an upper-case letter or another underscore.

B.1 Input and Output: <stdio.h>

The input and output functions, types, and macros defined in <stdio.h> represent nearly one
third of the library.

A  stream  is  a  source  or  destination  of  data  that  may  be  associated  with  a  disk  or  other
peripheral. The library supports text streams and binary streams, although on some systems,
notably UNIX, these are identical. A text stream is a sequence of lines; each line has zero or
more characters and is terminated by '\n'. An environment may need to convert a text stream
to or from some other representation (such as mapping '\n' to carriage return and linefeed).
A binary stream is a sequence of unprocessed bytes that record internal data, with the property
that if it is written, then read back on the same system, it will compare equal.

A stream is connected to a file or device by opening it; the connection is broken by closing
the stream. Opening a file returns a pointer to an object of type FILE, which records whatever
information  is  necessary  to  control  the  stream.  We  will  use  "file  pointer"  and  "stream"
interchangeably when there is no ambiguity.

When a program begins execution, the three streams stdin, stdout, and stderr are already
open.

B.1.1 File Operations





The  following  functions  deal  with  operations  on  files.  The  type  size_t  is  the  unsigned
integral type produced by the sizeof operator.
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode)

fopen opens the named file, and returns a stream, or NULL if the attempt fails. Legal
values for mode include:

221

"r"  open text file for reading
"w"  create text file for writing; discard previous contents if any
"a"  append; open or create text file for writing at end of file
"r+"  open text file for update (i.e., reading and writing)
"w+"  create text file for update, discard previous contents if any
"a+"  append; open or create text file for update, writing at end

Update mode permits reading and writing the same file; fflush or a file-positioning
function must be called between a read and a write or vice versa. If the mode includes
b after the initial letter, as in "rb" or "w+b", that indicates a binary file. Filenames are
limited to FILENAME_MAX characters. At most FOPEN_MAX files may be open at once.

FILE *freopen(const char *filename, const char *mode, FILE *stream)

freopen  opens  the  file  with  the  specified  mode  and  associates  the  stream  with  it.  It
returns  stream,  or  NULL  if  an  error  occurs.  freopen  is  normally  used  to  change  the
files associated with stdin, stdout, or stderr.

int fflush(FILE *stream)

On an output stream, fflush causes any buffered but unwritten data to be written; on
an  input  stream,  the  effect  is  undefined.  It  returns  EOF  for  a  write  error,  and  zero
otherwise. fflush(NULL) flushes all output streams.

int fclose(FILE *stream)

fclose  flushes  any  unwritten  data  for  stream,  discards  any  unread  buffered  input,
frees any automatically allocated buffer, then closes the stream. It returns  EOF if any
errors occurred, and zero otherwise.

int remove(const char *filename)

remove  removes  the  named  file,  so  that  a  subsequent  attempt  to  open  it  will  fail.  It
returns non-zero if the attempt fails.

int rename(const char *oldname, const char *newname)

rename changes the name of a file; it returns non-zero if the attempt fails.

FILE *tmpfile(void)

tmpfile creates a temporary file of mode  "wb+" that will be automatically removed
when closed or when the program terminates normally. tmpfile returns a stream, or
NULL if it could not create the file.

char *tmpnam(char s[L_tmpnam])

tmpnam(NULL) creates a string that is not the name of an existing file, and returns a
pointer to an internal static array. tmpnam(s) stores the string in s as well as returning
it  as  the  function  value;  s must have room for at least  L_tmpnam characters.  tmpnam
generates a different name each time it is called; at most TMP_MAX different names are
guaranteed during execution of the program. Note that  tmpnam creates a name, not a
file.

int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size)

setvbuf controls buffering for the stream; it must be called before reading, writing or
any other operation. A mode of _IOFBF causes full buffering, _IOLBF line buffering of
text files, and  _IONBF no buffering. If  buf is not  NULL, it will be used as the buffer,
otherwise a buffer will be allocated. size determines the buffer size. setvbuf returns
non-zero for any error.

void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf)



If buf is NULL, buffering is turned off for the stream. Otherwise, setbuf is equivalent
to (void) setvbuf(stream, buf, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ).

222

B.1.2 Formatted Output

The printf functions provide formatted output conversion.

   int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)
fprintf converts and writes output to stream under the control of format. The return value
is the number of characters written, or negative if an error occurred.

The format string contains two types of objects: ordinary characters, which are copied to the
output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which causes conversion and printing of
the  next  successive  argument  to  fprintf.  Each  conversion  specification  begins  with  the
character % and ends with a conversion character. Between the % and the conversion character
there may be, in order:

•  Flags (in any order), which modify the specification:

o  -, which specifies left adjustment of the converted argument in its field.
o  +, which specifies that the number will always be printed with a sign.
o  space: if the first character is not a sign, a space will be prefixed.
o  0:  for  numeric  conversions,  specifies  padding  to  the  field  width  with  leading

zeros.

o  #, which specifies an alternate output form. For  o, the first digit will become
zero. For x or X, 0x or 0X will be prefixed to a non-zero result. For e, E, f, g,
and G, the output will always have a decimal point; for g and G, trailing zeros
will not be removed.

•  A number specifying a minimum field width. The converted argument will be printed
in  a  field  at  least  this  wide,  and  wider  if  necessary.  If  the  converted  argument  has
fewer  characters  than  the  field  width  it  will  be  padded  on  the  left  (or  right,  if  left
adjustment has been requested) to make up the field width. The padding character is
normally space, but is 0 if the zero padding flag is present.
•  A period, which separates the field width from the precision.
•  A  number,  the  precision,  that  specifies  the  maximum  number  of  characters  to  be
printed from a string, or the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point for
e, E, or f conversions, or the number of significant digits for g or G conversion, or the
number of digits to be printed for an integer (leading 0s will be added to make up the
necessary width).

•  A length modifier h, l (letter ell), or L. "h" indicates that the corresponding argument
is to be printed as a short or unsigned short; "l" indicates that the argument is a
long or unsigned long, "L" indicates that the argument is a long double.

Width  or  precision  or  both  may  be  specified  as  *,  in  which  case  the  value  is  computed  by
converting the next argument(s), which must be int.

The conversion characters and their meanings are shown in Table B.1. If the character after
the % is not a conversion character, the behavior is undefined.

unsigned int; unsigned hexadecimal notation (without a leading 0x or 0X),
using abcdef for 0x or ABCDEF for 0X.

int; unsigned decimal notation.

int; single character, after conversion to unsigned char

char *; characters from the string are printed until a '\0' is reached or until the
number of characters indicated by the precision have been printed.

double; decimal notation of the form [-]mmm.ddd, where the number of d's is
given by the precision. The default precision is 6; a precision of 0 suppresses the
decimal point.

double; decimal notation of the form [-]m.dddddde+/-xx or [-]m.ddddddE+/-
xx, where the number of d's is specified by the precision. The default precision is
6; a precision of 0 suppresses the decimal point.

double; %e or %E is used if the exponent is less than -4 or greater than or equal to
the precision; otherwise %f is used. Trailing zeros and a trailing decimal point are
not printed.

void *; print as a pointer (implementation-dependent representation).

int *; the number of characters written so far by this call to printf is written
into the argument. No argument is converted.

%
int printf(const char *format, ...)

no argument is converted; print a %

printf(...) is equivalent to fprintf(stdout, ...).

int sprintf(char *s, const char *format, ...)

sprintf  is  the  same  as  printf  except  that  the  output  is  written  into  the  string  s,
terminated with '\0'. s must be big enough to hold the result. The return count does
not include the '\0'.

The functions vprintf, vfprintf, and vsprintf are equivalent to the corresponding
printf functions, except that the variable argument list is replaced by arg, which has
been initialized by the va_start macro and perhaps va_arg calls. See the discussion
of <stdarg.h> in Section B.7.

B.1.3 Formatted Input

The scanf function deals with formatted input conversion.

int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)
fscanf  reads  from  stream  under  control  of  format,  and  assigns  converted  values  through
subsequent arguments, each of which must be a pointer. It returns when format is exhausted.
fscanf returns EOF if end of file or an error occurs before any conversion; otherwise it returns
the number of input items converted and assigned.

The  format  string  usually  contains  conversion  specifications,  which  are  used  to  direct
interpretation of input. The format string may contain:

•  Blanks or tabs, which are not ignored.




224

•  Ordinary  characters  (not  %),  which  are  expected  to  match  the  next  non-white  space

character of the input stream.

•  Conversion  specifications,  consisting  of  a  %,  an  optional  assignment  suppression
character *, an optional number specifying a maximum field width, an optional h, l, or
L indicating the width of the target, and a conversion character.

A  conversion  specification  determines  the  conversion  of  the  next  input  field.  Normally  the
result  is  placed  in  the  variable  pointed  to  by  the  corresponding  argument.  If  assignment
suppression  is  indicated  by  *,  as  in  %*s,  however,  the  input  field  is  simply  skipped;  no
assignment  is  made.  An  input  field  is  defined  as  a  string  of  non-white  space  characters;  it
extends  either  to  the  next  white  space  character  or  until  the  field  width,  if  specified,  is
exhausted.  This  implies  that  scanf  will  read  across  line  boundaries  to  find  its  input,  since
newlines  are  white  space.  (White  space  characters  are  blank,  tab,  newline,  carriage  return,
vertical tab, and formfeed.)

The  conversion  character  indicates  the  interpretation  of  the  input  field.  The  corresponding
argument must be a pointer. The legal conversion characters are shown in Table B.2.

The  conversion  characters  d,  i,  n,  o,  u,  and  x  may  be  preceded  by  h  if  the  argument  is  a
pointer to short rather than int, or by l (letter ell) if the argument is a pointer to long. The
conversion  characters  e,  f,  and  g  may  be  preceded  by  l  if  a  pointer  to  double  rather  than
float is in the argument list, and by L if a pointer to a long double.

int scanf(const char *format, ...)

scanf(...) is identical to fscanf(stdin, ...).

int sscanf(const char *s, const char *format, ...)

sscanf(s,  ...)  is  equivalent  to  scanf(...)  except  that  the  input  characters  are
taken from the string s.

B.1.4 Character Input and Output Functions

int fgetc(FILE *stream)

fgetc  returns  the  next  character  of  stream  as  an  unsigned  char  (converted  to  an
int), or EOF if end of file or error occurs.

char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream)

fgets reads at most the next n-1 characters into the array s, stopping if a newline is
encountered; the newline is included in the array, which is terminated by '\0'. fgets
returns s, or NULL if end of file or error occurs.

int fputc(int c, FILE *stream)

fputc writes the character c (converted to an unsigend char) on stream. It returns
the character written, or EOF for error.

int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream)

fputs  writes  the  string  s  (which  need  not  contain  \n)  on  stream;  it  returns  non-
negative, or EOF for an error.

int getc(FILE *stream)

getc is equivalent to fgetc except that if it is a macro, it may evaluate stream more
than once.

int getchar(void)

getchar is equivalent to getc(stdin).

char *gets(char *s)

gets reads the next input line into the array s; it replaces the terminating newline with
'\0'. It returns s, or NULL if end of file or error occurs.

int putc(int c, FILE *stream)

putc is equivalent to fputc except that if it is a macro, it may evaluate stream more
than once.

int putchar(int c)

putchar(c) is equivalent to putc(c,stdout).

int puts(const char *s)

puts  writes  the  string  s  and  a  newline  to  stdout.  It  returns  EOF  if  an  error  occurs,
non-negative otherwise.
int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream)

ungetc pushes c (converted to an unsigned char) back onto stream, where it will be
returned on the next read. Only one character of pushback per stream is guaranteed.
EOF  may  not  be  pushed  back.  ungetc  returns  the  character  pushed  back,  or  EOF  for
error.

B.1.5 Direct Input and Output Functions

size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nobj, FILE *stream)

fread reads from stream into the array ptr at most nobj objects of size size. fread
returns the number of objects read; this may be less than the number requested. feof
and ferror must be used to determine status.

size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nobj, FILE *stream)



226

fwrite writes, from the array ptr, nobj objects of size size on stream. It returns the
number of objects written, which is less than nobj on error.

B.1.6 File Positioning Functions

int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin)

fseek  sets  the  file  position  for  stream;  a  subsequent  read  or  write  will  access  data
beginning  at  the  new  position.  For  a  binary  file,  the  position  is  set  to  offset
characters  from  origin,  which  may  be  SEEK_SET  (beginning),  SEEK_CUR  (current
position), or SEEK_END (end of file). For a text stream, offset must be zero, or a value
returned by ftell (in which case origin must be SEEK_SET). fseek returns non-zero
on error.

long ftell(FILE *stream)

ftell returns the current file position for stream, or -1 on error.

void rewind(FILE *stream)

rewind(fp) is equivalent to fseek(fp, 0L, SEEK_SET); clearerr(fp).

int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *ptr)

fgetpos  records  the  current  position  in  stream  in  *ptr,  for  subsequent  use  by
fsetpos. The type fpos_t is suitable for recording such values. fgetpos returns non-
zero on error.

int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *ptr)

fsetpos  positions  stream  at  the  position  recorded  by  fgetpos  in  *ptr.  fsetpos
returns non-zero on error.

B.1.7 Error Functions

Many of the functions in the library set status indicators when error or end of file occur. These
indicators may be set and tested explicitly. In addition, the integer expression errno (declared
in  <errno.h>)  may  contain  an  error  number  that  gives  further  information  about  the  most
recent error.
void clearerr(FILE *stream)

clearerr clears the end of file and error indicators for stream.

int feof(FILE *stream)

feof returns non-zero if the end of file indicator for stream is set.

int ferror(FILE *stream)

ferror returns non-zero if the error indicator for stream is set.

void perror(const char *s)

perror(s)  prints  s  and  an  implementation-defined  error  message  corresponding  to
the integer in errno, as if by

    fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\n", s, "error message");

See strerror in Section B.3.

B.2 Character Class Tests: <ctype.h>

The  header  <ctype.h>  declares  functions  for  testing  characters.  For  each  function,  the
argument list is an int, whose value must be EOF or representable as an unsigned char, and
the return value is an int. The functions return non-zero (true) if the argument c satisfies the
condition described, and zero if not.

isalnum(c)  isalpha(c) or isdigit(c) is true
isalpha(c)  isupper(c) or islower(c) is true



227

iscntrl(c)  control character
isdigit(c)  decimal digit
isgraph(c)  printing character except space
islower(c)
lower-case letter
isprint(c)  printing character including space
ispunct(c)  printing character except space or letter or digit
isspace(c)  space, formfeed, newline, carriage return, tab, vertical tab
isupper(c)  upper-case letter
isxdigit(c)  hexadecimal digit

In the seven-bit ASCII character set, the printing characters are 0x20 (' ') to 0x7E ('-');
the control characters are 0 NUL to 0x1F (US), and 0x7F (DEL).

In addition, there are two functions that convert the case of letters:

int tolower(c) convert c to lower case

int toupper(c) convert c to upper case

If  c  is  an  upper-case  letter,  tolower(c)  returns  the  corresponding  lower-case  letter,
toupper(c) returns the corresponding upper-case letter; otherwise it returns c.

B.3 String Functions: <string.h>

There  are  two  groups  of  string  functions  defined  in  the  header  <string.h>.  The  first  have
names beginning with str; the second have names beginning with mem. Except for memmove,
the  behavior  is  undefined  if  copying  takes  place  between  overlapping  objects.  Comparison
functions treat arguments as unsigned char arrays.

In  the  following  table,  variables  s  and  t  are  of  type  char  *;  cs  and  ct  are  of  type  const
char *; n is of type size_t; and c is an int converted to char.

char *strcpy(s,ct)  copy string ct to string s, including '\0'; return s.

char
*strncpy(s,ct,n)

copy at most n characters of string ct to s; return s. Pad with '\0"s
if ct has fewer than n characters.

char *strcat(s,ct)  concatenate string ct to end of string s; return s.

char
*strncat(s,ct,n)

concatenate at most n characters of string ct to string s, terminate s
with '\0'; return s.

int strcmp(cs,ct)

compare string cs to string ct, return <0 if cs<ct, 0 if cs==ct, or >0
if cs>ct.

int
strncmp(cs,ct,n)

compare at most n characters of string cs to string ct; return <0 if
cs<ct, 0 if cs==ct, or >0 if cs>ct.

char *strchr(cs,c)
return pointer to first occurrence of c in cs or NULL if not present.
char *strrchr(cs,c)  return pointer to last occurrence of c in cs or NULL if not present.
size_t
strspn(cs,ct)

return length of prefix of cs consisting of characters in ct.



228

size_t
strcspn(cs,ct)

char
*strpbrk(cs,ct)

return length of prefix of cs consisting of characters not in ct.

return pointer to first occurrence in string cs of any character string
ct, or NULL if not present.

char *strstr(cs,ct)  return pointer to first occurrence of string ct in cs, or NULL if not

present.

size_t strlen(cs)

char *strerror(n)

return length of cs.
return pointer to implementation-defined string corresponding to
error n.

char *strtok(s,ct)  strtok searches s for tokens delimited by characters from ct; see

below.

A sequence of calls of strtok(s,ct) splits s into tokens, each delimited by a character from
ct. The first call in a sequence has a non-NULL  s, it finds the first token in  s consisting of
characters not in  ct; it terminates that by overwriting the next character of s with '\0' and
returns a pointer to the token. Each subsequent call, indicated by a NULL value of s, returns the
next  such  token,  searching  from  just past the end of the previous one.  strtok returns  NULL
when no further token is found. The string ct may be different on each call.

The mem... functions are meant for manipulating objects as character arrays; the intent is an
interface to efficient routines. In the following table, s and t are of type void *; cs and ct
are of type  const  void  *;  n is of type  size_t; and  c is an  int converted to an  unsigned
char.

copy n characters from ct to s, and return s.

void
*memcpy(s,ct,n)
void
*memmove(s,ct,n)
int memcmp(cs,ct,n)  compare the first n characters of cs with ct; return as with strcmp.
return pointer to first occurrence of character c in cs, or NULL if not
present among the first n characters.

same as memcpy except that it works even if the objects overlap.

void
*memchr(cs,c,n)

void *memset(s,c,n)  place character c into first n characters of s, return s.

B.4 Mathematical Functions: <math.h>

The header <math.h> declares mathematical functions and macros.

The macros  EDOM and  ERANGE (found in <errno.h>) are non-zero integral constants that are
used  to  signal  domain  and  range  errors  for  the  functions;  HUGE_VAL  is  a  positive  double
value. A domain error occurs if an argument is outside the domain over which the function is
defined. On a domain error, errno is set to EDOM; the return value is implementation-defined.
A  range error occurs if the result of the function cannot be represented as a  double. If the
result  overflows,  the  function  returns  HUGE_VAL  with  the  right  sign,  and  errno  is  set  to
ERANGE. If the result underflows, the function returns zero; whether errno is set to ERANGE is
implementation-defined.

In  the  following  table,  x  and  y  are  of  type  double,  n  is  an  int,  and  all  functions  return
double. Angles for trigonometric functions are expressed in radians.

result is implementation-defined.

B.5 Utility Functions: <stdlib.h>

The  header  <stdlib.h>  declares  functions  for  number  conversion,  storage  allocation,  and
similar tasks. double atof(const char *s)

atof converts s to double; it is equivalent to strtod(s, (char**)NULL).

int atoi(const char *s)

converts s to int; it is equivalent to (int)strtol(s, (char**)NULL, 10).

long atol(const char *s)

converts s to long; it is equivalent to strtol(s, (char**)NULL, 10).

double strtod(const char *s, char **endp)

strtod  converts  the  prefix  of  s  to  double,  ignoring  leading  white  space;  it  stores  a
pointer to any unconverted suffix in *endp unless endp is NULL. If the answer would
overflow, HUGE_VAL is returned with the proper sign; if the answer would underflow,
zero is returned. In either case errno is set to ERANGE.
long strtol(const char *s, char **endp, int base)

strtol  converts  the  prefix  of  s  to  long,  ignoring  leading  white  space;  it  stores  a
pointer to any unconverted suffix in *endp unless endp is NULL. If base is between 2



230

and 36, conversion is done assuming that the input is written in that base. If  base is
zero,  the  base  is  8,  10,  or  16;  leading  0  implies  octal  and  leading  0x  or  0X
hexadecimal. Letters in either case represent digits from 10 to base-1; a leading 0x or
0X is permitted in base 16. If the answer would overflow,  LONG_MAX or  LONG_MIN is
returned, depending on the sign of the result, and errno is set to ERANGE.

unsigned long strtoul(const char *s, char **endp, int base)

strtoul is the same as strtol except that the result is unsigned long and the error
value is ULONG_MAX.

int rand(void)

rand  returns  a  pseudo-random  integer  in  the  range  0  to  RAND_MAX,  which  is  at  least
32767.

void srand(unsigned int seed)

srand  uses  seed  as  the  seed  for  a  new  sequence  of  pseudo-random  numbers.  The
initial seed is 1.

void *calloc(size_t nobj, size_t size)

calloc returns a pointer to space for an array of nobj objects, each of size size, or
NULL if the request cannot be satisfied. The space is initialized to zero bytes.

void *malloc(size_t size)

malloc  returns  a  pointer  to  space  for  an  object  of  size  size,  or  NULL  if  the  request
cannot be satisfied. The space is uninitialized.

void *realloc(void *p, size_t size)

realloc changes the size of the object pointed to by p to size. The contents will be
unchanged up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. If the new size is larger, the
new space is uninitialized. realloc returns a pointer to the new space, or NULL if the
request cannot be satisfied, in which case *p is unchanged.

void free(void *p)

free deallocates the space pointed to by p; it does nothing if p is NULL. p must be a
pointer to space previously allocated by calloc, malloc, or realloc.

void abort(void)

abort causes the program to terminate abnormally, as if by raise(SIGABRT).

void exit(int status)

exit causes normal program termination. atexit functions are called in reverse order
of registration, open files are flushed, open streams are closed, and control is returned
to  the  environment.  How  status  is  returned  to  the  environment  is  implementation-
dependent, but zero is taken as successful termination. The values EXIT_SUCCESS and
EXIT_FAILURE may also be used.

int atexit(void (*fcn)(void))

atexit registers the function fcn to be called when the program terminates normally;
it returns non-zero if the registration cannot be made.

int system(const char *s)

system  passes  the  string  s  to  the  environment  for  execution.  If  s  is  NULL,  system
returns non-zero if there is a command processor. If s is not NULL, the return value is
implementation-dependent.

char *getenv(const char *name)

getenv  returns  the  environment  string  associated  with  name,  or  NULL  if  no  string
exists. Details are implementation-dependent.

void *bsearch(const void *key, const void *base,
              size_t n, size_t size,
              int (*cmp)(const void *keyval, const void *datum))

bsearch searches base[0]...base[n-1] for an item that matches *key. The function
cmp must return negative if its first argument (the search key) is less than its second (a
table entry), zero if equal, and positive if greater. Items in the array base must be in
ascending order. bsearch returns a pointer to a matching item, or NULL if none exists.




231

void qsort(void *base, size_t n, size_t size,
           int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *))

qsort  sorts  into  ascending  order  an  array  base[0]...base[n-1]  of  objects  of  size
size. The comparison function cmp is as in bsearch.

int abs(int n)

abs returns the absolute value of its int argument.

long labs(long n)

labs returns the absolute value of its long argument.

div_t div(int num, int denom)

div computes the quotient and remainder of num/denom. The results are stored in the
int members quot and rem of a structure of type div_t.

ldiv_t ldiv(long num, long denom)

ldiv computes the quotient and remainder of num/denom. The results are stored in the
long members quot and rem of a structure of type ldiv_t.

B.6 Diagnostics: <assert.h>

The assert macro is used to add diagnostics to programs:

  void assert(int expression)

If expression is zero when

  assert(expression)

is executed, the assert macro will print on stderr a message, such as

  Assertion failed: expression, file filename, line nnn

It then calls  abort to terminate execution. The source filename and line number come from
the preprocessor macros __FILE__ and __LINE__.

If NDEBUG is defined at the time <assert.h> is included, the assert macro is ignored.

B.7 Variable Argument Lists: <stdarg.h>

The header  <stdarg.h> provides facilities for stepping through a list of function arguments
of unknown number and type.

Suppose  lastarg  is  the  last  named  parameter  of  a  function  f  with  a  variable  number  of
arguments. Then declare within f a variable of type va_list that will point to each argument
in turn:

   va_list ap;
ap  must  be  initialized  once  with  the  macro  va_start  before  any  unnamed  argument  is
accessed:

  va_start(va_list ap, lastarg);





Thereafter,  each  execution  of  the  macro  va_arg  will  produce  a  value  that  has  the  type  and
value  of  the  next  unnamed  argument,  and  will  also  modify  ap  so  the  next  use  of  va_arg
returns the next argument:

232

  type va_arg(va_list ap, type);

The macro

   void va_end(va_list ap);
must be called once after the arguments have been processed but before f is exited.

B.8 Non-local Jumps: <setjmp.h>

The declarations in  <setjmp.h> provide a way to avoid the normal function call and return
sequence, typically to permit an immediate return from a deeply nested function call.
int setjmp(jmp_buf env)

The macro  setjmp saves state information in  env for use by  longjmp. The return is
zero from a direct call of setjmp, and non-zero from a subsequent call of longjmp. A
call to setjmp can only occur in certain contexts, basically the test of if, switch, and
loops, and only in simple relational expressions.

      if (setjmp(env) == 0)
          /* get here on direct call */
      else
          /* get here by calling longjmp */
void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val)

longjmp  restores  the  state  saved  by  the  most  recent  call  to  setjmp,  using  the
information  saved  in  env,  and  execution  resumes  as  if  the  setjmp  function  had  just
executed  and  returned  the  non-zero  value  val.  The  function  containing  the  setjmp
must  not  have  terminated.  Accessible  objects  have  the  values  they  had  at  the  time
longjmp  was  called,  except  that  non-volatile  automatic  variables  in  the  function
calling setjmp become undefined if they were changed after the setjmp call.

B.9 Signals: <signal.h>

The  header  <signal.h>  provides  facilities  for  handling  exceptional  conditions  that  arise
during execution, such as an interrupt signal from an external source or an error in execution.

void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int)))(int)
signal  determines  how  subsequent  signals  will  be  handled.  If  handler  is  SIG_DFL,  the
implementation-defined  default  behavior  is  used,  if  it  is  SIG_IGN,  the  signal  is  ignored;
otherwise, the function pointed to by handler will be called, with the argument of the type of
signal. Valid signals include

abnormal termination, e.g., from abort
arithmetic error, e.g., zero divide or overflow

SIGABRT
SIGFPE
SIGILL
SIGINT
SIGSEGV
SIGTERM    termination request sent to this program

illegal function image, e.g., illegal instruction

interactive attention, e.g., interrupt

illegal storage access, e.g., access outside memory limits






233

signal returns the previous value of handler for the specific signal, or SIG_ERR if an error
occurs.

When a signal sig subsequently occurs, the signal is restored to its default behavior; then the
signal-handler function is called, as if by (*handler)(sig). If the handler returns, execution
will resume where it was when the signal occurred.

The initial state of signals is implementation-defined.

int raise(int sig)
raise sends the signal sig to the program; it returns non-zero if unsuccessful.

B.10 Date and Time Functions: <time.h>

The  header  <time.h>  declares  types  and  functions  for  manipulating  date  and  time.  Some
functions  process  local  time,  which  may  differ  from  calendar  time,  for  example  because  of
time zone. clock_t and time_t are arithmetic types representing times, and struct tm holds
the components of a calendar time:

int tm_sec;   seconds after the minute (0,61)
int tm_min;   minutes after the hour (0,59)
int tm_hour;  hours since midnight (0,23)

int tm_mday;  day of the month (1,31)
int tm_mon;   months since January (0,11)
int tm_year;  years since 1900

int tm_wday;  days since Sunday (0,6)

int tm_yday;  days since January 1 (0,365)

int tm_isdst; Daylight Saving Time flag

tm_isdst  is  positive  if  Daylight  Saving  Time  is  in  effect,  zero  if  not,  and  negative  if  the
information is not available.

clock_t clock(void)

clock  returns  the  processor  time  used  by  the  program  since  the  beginning  of
execution, or -1 if unavailable. clock()/CLK_PER_SEC is a time in seconds.

time_t time(time_t *tp)

time returns the current calendar time or  -1 if the time is not available. If  tp is not
NULL, the return value is also assigned to *tp.
double difftime(time_t time2, time_t time1)

difftime returns time2-time1 expressed in seconds.

time_t mktime(struct tm *tp)

mktime  converts  the  local  time  in  the  structure  *tp  into  calendar  time  in  the  same
representation used by  time. The components will have values in the ranges shown.
mktime returns the calendar time or -1 if it cannot be represented.

The next four functions return pointers to static objects that may be overwritten by other calls.
char *asctime(const struct tm *tp)






234

asctime</tt< converts the time in the structure *tp into a string of
the form

      Sun Jan  3 15:14:13 1988\n\0

char *ctime(const time_t *tp)

ctime converts the calendar time *tp to local time; it is equivalent
to

      asctime(localtime(tp))

struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *tp)

gmtime converts the calendar time *tp into Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC).  It  returns  NULL  if  UTC  is  not  available.  The  name  gmtime  has
historical significance.

struct tm *localtime(const time_t *tp)

localtime converts the calendar time *tp into local time.

size_t strftime(char *s, size_t smax, const char *fmt, const struct tm *tp)
strftime formats date and time information from *tp into s according
to  fmt,  which  is  analogous  to  a  printf  format.  Ordinary  characters
(including  the  terminating  '\0')  are  copied  into  s.  Each  %c  is
replaced  as  described  below,  using  values  appropriate  for  the  local
environment. No more than smax characters are placed into s. strftime
returns the number of characters, excluding the '\0', or zero if more
than smax characters were produced.
