+ Part 2 - Advanced 0MQ

The second part of this book is about software engineering using 0MQ. I'll introduce a set of techniques of software development, and demonstrate them with worked examples, starting with 0MQ itself and ending with a general purpose framework for distributed applications. These techniques are independent of license, though open source amplifies them.
