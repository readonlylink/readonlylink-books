title: Preface
---

This is an unpublished book I wrote long ago. Just after I'd written the
first versions of Forth. Perhaps it explains the motivation behind
Forth. There is some interest in it, and publishing is no longer
relevant since I can post it on my website.

I have a typescript that I recovered from Forth, Inc long ago. I had
typed it on my Smith-Corona portable, complete with overstrikes and
annotations. It is illegible enough to discourage a casual reader, so
I'm re-keying it in HTML.

This is useful, since I used to be a good typist and that skill
has deteriorated. My fingers can use the exercise and I'm curious if I
can reduce my error rate.

I'm making minimal changes to the text; just enough to fit HTML.
The language remains quaint, ungrammatical or unclear. Any remaining
typos are modern.
